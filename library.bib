abstract = {The term urban heat island describes the phenomenon of altered temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural hinterlands. A surface urban heat island encompasses the patterns of land surface temperatures in urban areas. The classical indicator to describe a surface urban heat island is the difference between urban and rural surface temperatures. However, several other indicators for this purpose have been suggested in the literature. In this study, we compared the eleven different indicators for quantifying surface urban heat islands that were most frequently used in recent publications on remote sensing-based urban heat island assessments. The dataset used here consists of 263 European cities with monthly mean temperatures from MODIS data products for July 2002, January 2003 and July 2003. We found that (i) the indicators individually reveal diurnal and seasonal patterns but show rather low correlations over time, and (ii) for single points in time, the different indicators show only weak correlations, although they are supposed to quantify the same phenomenon. Differentiating cities according to thermal climate zones increased the relationships between the indicators. Thus, we can identify temporal aspects and indicator selection as important factors determining the estimation of urban heat islands. We conclude that research should take into account the differences and instabilities of the indicators chosen for quantifying surface urban heat islands and should use several indicators in parallel for describing the surface urban heat island of a city. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The urban heat island impacts the thermal comfort of pedestrians in cities. In this paper, the effects of four heat mitigation strategies on micrometeorology and the thermal comfort of pedestrians were simulated for a neighborhood in eastern Los Angeles County. The strategies investigated include solar reflective 'cool roofs', vegetative 'green roofs', solar reflective 'cool pavements', and increased street-level trees. A series of micrometeorological simulations for an extreme heat day were carried out assuming widespread adoption of each mitigation strategy. Comparing each simulation to the control simulation assuming current land cover for the neighborhood showed that additional street-trees and cool pavements reduced 1.5 m air temperature, while cool and green roofs mostly provided cooling at heights above pedestrian level. However, cool pavements increased reflected sunlight from the ground to pedestrians at a set of unshaded receptor locations. This reflected radiation intensified the mean radiant temperature and consequently increased physiological equivalent temperature (PET) by 2.2 °C during the day, reducing the thermal comfort of pedestrians. At another set of receptor locations that were on average 5 m from roadways and underneath preexisting tree cover, cool pavements caused significant reductions in surface air temperatures and small changes in mean radiant temperature during the day, leading to decreases in PET of 1.1 °C, and consequent improvements in thermal comfort. For improving thermal comfort of pedestrians during the afternoon in unshaded locations, adding street trees was found to be the most effective strategy. However, afternoon thermal comfort improvements in already shaded locations adjacent to streets were most significant for cool pavements. Green and cool roofs showed the lowest impact on the thermal comfort of pedestrians since they modify the energy balance at roof level, above the height of pedestrians.},

abstract = {New developments of the international community in modeling the urban canopy surface energy balance are presented and classified into five main categories: (i) models statistically fit to observations, (ii) and (iii) modified vegetation schemes with or without drag terms in the canopy, and (iv) and (v), new urban canopy schemes, that present both horizontal and vertical surfaces, again with or without a drag approach. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of model are explained. In general, the more the physics are correctly simulated, the more complex are the urban phenomenon that can be addressed, on the other hand however, the more consuming of computer-time and difficult to couple with atmospheric models the scheme becomes. Present use of these new models in meso-scale atmospheric models show their ability to reproduce the phenomenon of the urban heat island (UHI) and some of its consequences urban breezes, storm initiation, interaction with sea-breeze. Their use opens up new perspectives, for example in the mitigation of the UHI, or assessment of the role of air-conditioning systems or the impact of urban dynamics on air pollution. However, there is need to validate further the different urban models available. In particular it is necessary to compare model output with urban surface energy balance measurements. An intercomparison exercise involving these urban schemes is suggested as an efficient way to assess and improve these models.},

Low resolution data from MODIS sensor with high revisiting time have been used to analyze the daily variation of Land Surface Temperature (LST), the derived Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at city level. Medium resolution data from ASTER and LANDSAT 7 sensors have been used for spot assessment of the above mentioned parameters at district level. With medium resolution satellites, LST and NDVI have been analyzed in correspondence of different level of Impervious Surface Areas (ISAs) over the study period. With both datasets, the obtained results showed an inversion of the standard SUHI phenomenon during daytime, where the downtown areas appear colder compared to the suburbs. Throughout the study period, the trend has been replicated and seasonality is also observed, where the inversion of SUHI is accentuated mainly in the summer months with a daily difference of 5–6K compared to 2–3K during the winter season, while the standard SUHI can be observed during the night with values of downtown 2–3K higher than the suburbs. Spot analysis of single images confirmed this trend, adding the contribution of ISA to an average increment of 1K during winter and 2K during the summer.},

In this urban parameterization, the city is represented as a combination of three urban classes (road, roof and wall), characterized by the size of the street canyon and the building and is thus able to take into account the momentum sink over the entire height of the building, as well as the shadowing and the radiation trapping effects. A control experiment including all the urban parameters describing the city centre of Basel produced a canyon air temperature that compared well with observations. A series of experiments was then conducted in which successively each of the urban parameters characterizing the city centre was changed providing the basis for an assessment of its effect on UHI mitigation.

abstract = {Elevated summertime temperatures in urban 'heat islands' increase cooling-energy use and accelerate the formation of urban smog. Except in the city's core areas, summer heat islands are created mainly by the lack of vegetation and by the high solar radiation absorptance by urban surfaces. Analysis of temperature trends for the last 100 years in several large U.S. cities indicate that, since ??? 1940, temperatures in urban areas have increased by about 0.5-3.0??C. Typically, electricity demand in cities increases by 2-4% for each 1??C increase in temperature. Hence, we estimate that 5-10% of the current urban electricity demand is spent to cool buildings just to compensate for the increased 0.5-3.0??C in urban temperatures. Downtown Los Angeles (L.A.), for example, is now 2.5??C warmer than in 1920, leading to an increase in electricity demand of 1500 MW. In L.A., smoggy episodes are absent below about 21??C, but smog becomes unacceptable by 32??C. Because of the heat-island effects, a rise in temperature can have significant impacts. Urban trees and high-albedo surfaces can offset or reverse the heat-island effect. Mitigation of urban heat islands can potentially reduce national energy use in air conditioning by 20% and save over $10B per year in energy use and improvement in urban air quality. The albedo of a city may be increased at minimal cost if high-albedo surfaces are chosen to replace darker materials during routine maintenance of roots and roads. Incentive programs, product labeling, and standards cloud promote the use of high-albedo materials for buildings and roads. Similar incentive-based programs need to be developed for urban trees.

abstract = {The Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary approximately 65.5 million years ago marks one of the three largest mass extinctions in the past 500 million years. The extinction event coincided with a large asteroid impact at Chicxulub, Mexico, and occurred within the time of Deccan flood basalt volcanism in India. Here, we synthesize records of the global stratigraphy across this boundary to assess the proposed causes of the mass extinction. Notably, a single ejecta-rich deposit compositionally linked to the Chicxulub impact is globally distributed at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The temporal match between the ejecta layer and the onset of the extinctions and the agreement of ecological patterns in the fossil record with modeled environmental perturbations (for example, darkness and cooling) lead us to conclude that the Chicxulub impact triggered the mass extinction.},

abstract = {A generalized approach for estimating season-specific diurnal profiles of anthropogenic heating for cities is presented. Each profile consists of heat released from three components: building sector, transportation sector, and metabolism. In turn, the building sector is divided into heat released from electricity consumption and heat released from heating fuels such as natural gas and fuel oil. Each component is developed separately based on a population density formulation. The profiles are based on commonly available data resources that are mapped onto the diurnal cycle using seasonal profile functions. Representative winter and summer weekday profiles are developed and presented for six large US cities. The diurnal profiles have morning and evening peaks, with summertime maxima up to 60Wm
                        -2. Anthropogenic heating in winter is generally larger, with maxima up to 75Wm
                        -2. While these analyses were carried out at the city-scale the paper discusses how the same data sources could be applied at scales down to the individual census tract (or traffic analysis zone), resulting in high spatial resolution profiles and larger maxima corresponding to higher population densities in the urban core. Based on our analysis of San Francisco we find that the urban core region may have a daytime population density that is 5-10 times that of the city-scale value. Hence, the corresponding anthropogenic heating values in the urban core will be 5-10 times the magnitudes of the city-scale values presented in this paper. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urban parks can help mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects and decrease cooling energy consumption in summer. However, it is unclear how park characteristics affect the formation of a park cool island (PCI). In this study, PCI intensity values for 92 parks in Nagoya, Japan were obtained from ASTER land surface temperature (LST) products and then correlated to detailed and use information derived from high-spatial-resolution IKONOS satellite data. The results indicate that (1) the cooling effect depends on the park size and seasonal radiation condition, and park size is non-linearly correlated to PCI intensity; (2) PCI intensity is mainly determined by the area of tree and shrub inside the park as well as the park shape, and grass has negative impact on PCI formation. The park vegetation and shape index (PVSI) proposed here well predicted PCI intensity of selected parks. These findings can help urban planners to understand PCI formation and design cool parks to counteract UHI effects. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST) from the thermal band data of Landsat ThematicMapper (TM) still remains unused in comparison with the extensive studies of its visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands for various applications. The brightness temperature can be computed from the digital number (DN) of TM6 data using the equation provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, a proper algorithm for retrieving LST from the only one thermal band of the sensor still remains unavailable due to many diYculties in the atmospheric correction. Based on thermal radiance transfer equation, an attempt has been made in the paper to develop a mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST from Landsat TM6 data. Three parameters are required for the algorithm: emissivity, transmittance and eVective mean atmospheric temperature. Method about determination of atmo- spheric transmittance is given in the paper through the simulation of atmospheric conditions with LOWTRAN 7 program. A practicable approach of estimating eVective mean atmospheric temperature from local meteorological observation is also proposed in the paper when the in situ atmospheric pro? le data is unavailable at the satellite pass, which is generally the case in the real world especially for the images in the past. Sensitivity analysis of the algorithm indicates that the possible error of ground emissivity, which is diYcult to estimate, has relatively insigni? cant impact on the probable LST estimation error dT , which is sensible to the possible error of transmittance dt6 and mean atmospheric temperature dT a. Validation of the simulated data for various situations of seven typical atmospheres indicates that the algorithm is able to provide an accurate LST retrieval from TM6 data. The LST diVerence between the retrieved and the simulated ones is less than 0.4°C for most situations. Application of the algorithm to the sand dunes across the Israel–Egypt border results in a reasonable LST},

The cases examined include a significant aerosol event (biomass burning), which by virtue of its vertical extent, provides a robust measure of the vertical range of the ceilometer for aerosol applications. A second case is presented when the instruments were separated in order to illustrate the utility of a network of such instruments for elucidating spatial patterns in aerosol distribution and the advection of elevated pollutant layers. When co-located, the instruments show remarkable agreement and indicate that the CL31 can detect aerosol layers up to 3000 m AGL in ideal conditions (at night and with high aerosol concentrations as found in biomass burning or dust plumes). When separated, multiple instruments provide an opportunity to examine advection of pollutant layers as well as their evolution. This suggests that installation of a ceilometer network would provide a cost-effective means of examining three-dimensional aspects of regional air quality as well as distinguishing between regional and local sources of pollution},

abstract = {The relative performance of four independent methods to estimate the magnitude and diurnal behavior of net heat storage fluxes (△QS) in a city center is assessed. This heat flux is a significant but understudied component of the urban surface energy balance (SEB). Direct measurement of this SEB term at the local scale (horizontal length scale ∼102-104 m) is practically unattainable primarily because of the complex array of materials and the three-dimensionality of urban systems. Results of an 8-day summertime observational study at a site in the center of Marseille, France, are presented. This locale is an ideal environment for such research because of the warm, dry climate (hence the SEB is dominated by sensible heat exchanges) and the high density of tall buildings with thick walls (hence it has a large thermal mass that favors heat storage as a component of the SEB). Estimates of △QS derived as residuals in the SEB, after the remaining terms are measured directly, (termed RES) are compared with those calculated from a parameterization scheme [objective hysteresis model (OHM)], a local-scale numerical model [Town Energy Balance model (TEB)], and a bulk heat transfer method [thermal mass scheme (TMS)]. Inputs to the methods include observed meteorological data and morphometric properties of the urban site. All approaches yield a similar diurnal course. The OHM and TEB methods tend to slightly overestimate storage uptake by day when compared with the RES, whereas TMS slightly underestimates it. All methods underestimate heat storage release at night when compared with RES and show some sensitivity to wind speed, especially above about 5 m s-1. OHM estimates perform satisfactorily in the mean but miss short-term variability and are poor at night. TEB simulations show the best agreement with RES results, particularly at night. TMS values are comparable to those from the other methods, but its extensive input requirements render it almost impractical. Overall, the convergence of results is reassuring but the lack of a standard for quantifying heat storage and the spread of results mean this term remains a source of imprecision in urban energy balance measurement and modeling. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

In this study, a supervised statistics-based method of determining and applying discretive parameters of rooftops in urban scenes of irregular composition is presented. After preprocessing to pansharpen IKONOS image data, the method includes the following steps: (1) image segmentation; (2) supervised object-based classification into broad spectral classes including impervious surfaces; (3) spectral, spatial, textural and contextual parameters are developed from statistical comparison of the sample rooftop and other impervious surface objects and (4) these parameters are implemented in a fuzzy logic rule base to separate rooftops from other impervious surfaces. Classification of a test scene results in 93% accuracy of rooftop identification, demonstrating the applicability of the method to the discrimination of spectrally similar but semantically variable classes.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in the urban environment impacts the urban surface energy budget and leads to the emission of anthropogenic sensible heat and moisture into the atmosphere. Anthropogenic heat and moisture emissions vary significantly both in time and space, and are not readily measured. As a result, detailed models of these emissions are not commonly available for most cities. Furthermore, most attempts to quantify anthropogenic emissions have focused on the sensible heat component, largely ignoring moisture emissions and invoking assumptions - such as the equivalence of energy consumption and anthropogenic sensible heating - which limit the accuracy of the resulting anthropogenic heating estimates. This paper provides a historical perspective of the development of models of energy consumption in the urban environment and the associated anthropogenic impacts on the urban energy balance. It highlights some fundamental limitations of past approaches and suggests a roadmap forward for including anthropogenic heat and moisture in modelling of the urban environment. Copyright.

abstract = {Objectives: To provide novel quantification and advanced measurements of surface temperatures (Ts) in playgrounds, employing multiple scales of data, and provide insight into hot-hazard mitigation techniques and designs for improved environmental and public health. Methods: We conduct an analysis of Ts in two Metro-Phoenix playgrounds at three scales: neighborhood (1km resolution), microscale (6.8m resolution), and touch-scale (1cm resolution). Data were derived from two sources: airborne remote sensing (neighborhood and microscale) and in situ (playground site) infrared Ts (touch-scale). Metrics of surface-to-air temperature deltas ($\delta$Ts-a) and scale offsets (errors) are introduced. Results: Select in situ Ts in direct sunlight are shown to approach or surpass values likely to result in burns to children at touch-scales much finer than Ts resolved by airborne remote sensing. Scale offsets based on neighbourhood and microscale ground observations are 3.8C and 7.3C less than the $\delta$Ts-a at the 1cm touch-scale, respectively, and 6.6C and 10.1C lower than touch-scale playground equipment Ts, respectively. Hence, the coarser scales underestimate high Ts within playgrounds. Both natural (tree) and artificial (shade sail) shade types are associated with significant reductions in Ts. Conclusions: A scale mismatch exists based on differing methods of urban Ts measurement. The sub-meter touch-scale is the spatial scale at which data must be collected and policies of urban landscape design and health must be executed in order to mitigate high Ts in high-contact environments such as playgrounds. Shade implementation is the most promising mitigation technique to reduce child burns, increase park usability, and mitigate urban heating.},

abstract = {The first measurements of the energy balance fluxes of a dry, densely built-up, central city site are presented. Direct observation of the net radiation, sensible and latent heat flux densities above roof-top in the old city district of Mexico City allow the heat storage flux density to be found by residual. The most important finding is that during daytime, when evaporation is very small (<4% of net radiation), and therefore sensible heat uses dominate (Bowen ratio >8), the uptake of heat by the buildings and substrate is so large (58%) that convective heating of the atmosphere is reduced to a smaller role than expected (38%). The nocturnal release of heat from storage is equal to or larger than the net radiation and sufficient to maintain an upward convective heat flux throughout most nights. It is important to see if this pattern is repeated at other central city, or dry urban sites, or whether it is only found in districts dominated by massive stone structures. These findings have implications for the height of the urban mixing layer and the magnitude of the urban heat island.},

abstract = {New developments of the international community in modeling the urban canopy surface energy balance are presented and classified into five main categories: (i) models statistically fit to observations, (ii) and (iii) modified vegetation schemes with or without drag terms in the canopy, and (iv) and (v), new urban canopy schemes, that present both horizontal and vertical surfaces, again with or without a drag approach. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of model are explained. In general, the more the physics are correctly simulated, the more complex are the urban phenomenon that can be addressed, on the other hand however, the more consuming of computer-time and difficult to couple with atmospheric models the scheme becomes. Present use of these new models in meso-scale atmospheric models show their ability to reproduce the phenomenon of the urban heat island (UHI) and some of its consequences urban breezes, storm initiation, interaction with sea-breeze. Their use opens up new perspectives, for example in the mitigation of the UHI, or assessment of the role of air-conditioning systems or the impact of urban dynamics on air pollution. However, there is need to validate further the different urban models available. In particular it is necessary to compare model output with urban surface energy balance measurements. An intercomparison exercise involving these urban schemes is suggested as an efficient way to assess and improve these models.},

This ‘new' measure (dr) is a reformulation of Willmott's index of agreement, which was developed in the 1980s. It (dr)is dimensionless, bounded by −1.0 and 1.0 and, in general, more rationally related to model accuracy than are other existing indices. It also is quite flexible, making it applicable to a wide range of model-performance problems. The two main published versions of Willmott's index as well as four other comparable dimensionless indices – proposed by Nash and Sutcliffe in 1970, Watterson in 1996, Legates and McCabe in 1999 and Mielke and Berry in 2001 – are compared with the new index. Of the six, Legates and McCabe's measure is most similar to dr. Repeated calculations of all six indices, from intensive random resamplings of predicted and observed spaces, are used to show the covariation and differences between the various indices, as well as their relative efficacies.

abstract = {e paper demonstrates the relationship existing between the size of a village, town or city (as measured by its population), and the magnitude of the urban heat island it produces. This is accomplished by analyzing data gathered by automobile traverses in 10 settlements on the St. Lawrence Lowland, whose populations range from 1000 to 2 million inhabitants. The locations of these settlements effectively eliminate all non-urban climatic influences. The results are compared with previously published data. The analysis shows the heat island intensity under cloudless skies to be related to the inverse of the regional windspeed, and the logarithm of the population. A simple model is derived which incorporates these controls. In agreement with an extension of Summers' model the heat island appears to be approximately proportional to the fourth root of the population. With calm and clear conditions the relation is shown to hold remarkably well for North American settlements, and in a slightly modified form, for European towns and cities.},

abstract = {This study reports on the radiation and energy balance of three sites (rural, suburban, and urban) located along an urbanization gradient in the Montreal, QC, region for two winters (DecemberMarch) with contrasting snow regimes. The urban and suburban sites had similar albedo which was about half that at the rural site during the snow-cover period. Temporal variability in albedo was attributable to the presence of snow on rooftops at the urban site and to a site-specific response to cloudiness at the suburban site. As compared to the suburban site, the urban site showed higher albedo inducing lower net radiation (Q) which was compensated for by greater anthropogenic heat flux (QF), so that the urban site had highest total available energy (Q QF). Hourly QF estimates were a significant term in the winter energy budget analysis. QF was dominated by building heating at both urbanized sites, while vehicular traffic contributed to rush hour peaks. Daytime total available energy was mostly dissipated as sensible heat flux (QH) at the beginning of the winter season and mostly stored ($\Delta$QS) towards the end of the winter at both urbanized sites. Daytime energy partitioning into QH and $\Delta$QS was correlated with air temperature with no significant differences between urbanized sites. On a daily time scale, available energy was mostly stored before noon and dissipated as QH in the afternoon at both urbanized sites. Urbanized sites showed differences in diurnal variability of QH and $\Delta$QS occurring in the afternoon and evening. Latent heat flux (QE) was low throughout winter and accounted for 10% of the total available energy during daytime at the urbanized sites. Water vapour emissions showed intra-urban differences in their response to wintertime climatic conditions. Copyright 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {Climate scenarios serve a number of functions in helping society manage climate change-pedagogic, motivational or practical (for example, in engineering design, spatial planning and policy development). A variety of methodologies for scenario construction have been experimented with, all of them to a greater or lesser extent depending on the use of climate models. Yet the development of climate scenarios involves much more than climate modelling. The process of scenario development is one of negotiation between relevant stakeholders-funding agencies, policy communities, scientists, social actors and decision-makers in a variety of sectors. This process of negotiation is illustrated through an analysis of four generations of UK climate scenarios-published in 1991, 1996, 1998 and 2002. Using ideas from science and technology studies and the sociology of scientific knowledge to guide our analysis, we reveal complex relationships between the interests of UK science, policy and society. Negotiating climate scenarios involves compromise between the needs of policy, science and decision-maker in relation to, for example, the selection of the development pathway(s) and emissions scenario(s), the choice of climate model(s), the assessment and communication of uncertainty and the presentational devices used. These insights have a significant bearing on the way in which climate scenarios should be viewed and used in public discourse, strategic planning and policy development. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Surface temperature is a key variable in boundary-layer meteorology and is typically acquired by remote observation of emitted thermal radiation. However, the three-dimensional structure of cities complicates matters: uneven solar heating of urban facets produces an “effective anisotropy” of surface thermal emission at the neighbourhood scale. Remotely-sensed urban surface temperature varies with sensor view angle as a consequence. The authors combine a microscale urban surface temperature model with a thermal remote sensing model to predict the effective anisotropy of simplified neighbourhood configurations. The former model provides detailed surface temperature distributions for a range of “urban” forms, and the remote sensing model computes aggregate temperatures for multiple view angles. The combined model's ability to reproduce observed anisotropy is evaluated against measurements from a neighbourhood in Vancouver, Canada. As in previous modeling studies, anisotropy is underestimated. Addition of moderate coverages of small (sub-facet scale) structure can account for much of the missing anisotropy. Subsequently, over 1900 sensitivity simulations are performed with the model combination, and the dependence of daytime effective thermal anisotropy on diurnal solar path (i.e., latitude and time of day) and blunt neighbourhood form is assessed. The range of effective anisotropy, as well as the maximum difference from nadir-observed brightness temperature, peak for moderate building-height-to-spacing ratios (H/W), and scale with canyon (between-building) area; dispersed high-rise urban forms generate maximum anisotropy. Maximum anisotropy increases with solar elevation and scales with shortwave irradiance. Moreover, it depends linearly on H/W for H/W < 1.25, with a slope that depends on maximum off-nadir sensor angle. Decreasing minimum brightness temperature is primarily responsible for this linear growth of maximum anisotropy. These results allow first order estimation of the minimum effective anisotropy magnitude of urban neighbourhoods as a function of building-height-to-spacing ratio, building plan area density, and shortwave irradiance. Finally, four “local climate zones” are simulated at two latitudes. Removal of neighbourhood street orientation regularity for these zones decreases maximum anisotropy by 3%–31%. Furthermore, thermal and radiative material properties are a weaker predictor of anisotropy than neighbourhood morphology. This study is the first systematic evaluation of effective anisotropy magnitude and causation for urban landscapes.},

abstract = {An urban energy and water balance model is presented which uses a small number of commonly measured meteorological variables and information about the surface cover. Rates of evaporation-interception for a single layer with multiple surface types (paved, buildings, coniferous trees and/or shrubs, deciduous trees and/or shrubs, irrigated grass, non-irrigated grass and water) are calculated. Below each surface type, except water, there is a single soil layer. At each time step the moisture state of each surface is calculated. Horizontal water movements at the surface and in the soil are incorporated. Particular attention is given to the surface conductance used to model evaporation and its parameters. The model is tested against direct flux measurements carried out over a number of years in Vancouver, Canada and Los Angeles, USA. At all measurement sites the model is able to simulate the net all-wave radiation and turbulent sensible and latent heat well (RMSE=25-47Wm-2, 30-64 and 20-56Wm-2, respectively). The model reproduces the diurnal cycle of the turbulent fluxes but typically underestimates latent heat flux and overestimates sensible heat flux in the day time. The model tracks measured surface wetness and simulates the variations in soil moisture content. It is able to respond correctly to short-term events as well as annual changes. The largest uncertainty relates to the determination of surface conductance. The model has the potential be used for multiple applications; for example, to predict effects of regulation on urban water use, landscaping and planning scenarios, or to assess climate mitigation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The DART (discrete anisotropic radiative transfer) model simulates radiative transfer in heterogeneous 3-D scenes that may comprise different landscape features; i.e., leaves, grass, trunks, water, soil. The scene is divided into a rectangular cell matrix, i.e., building block for simulating larger scenes. Cells are parallelipipedic. Their optical properties are represented by individual scattering phase functions that are directly input into the model or are computed with optical and structural characteristics of elements within the cell. Radiation scattering and propagation are simulated with the exact kernel and discrete ordinate approaches; any set of discrete direction can be selected. In addition to topography and hot spot, leaf specular and first-order polarization mechanisms are modeled. Two major iterative steps are distinguished: 1) Cell illumination with direct sun radiation: Within cell multiple scattering is accurately simulated. 2) Interception and scattering of previously scattered radiation: Atmospheric radiation, possibly anisotropic, is input at this stage. Multiple scattering is stored as spherical harmonics expansions, for reducing computer memory constraints. The model iterates on step 2, for all cells, and stops with the energetic equilibrium. Two simple accelerating techniques can be used: 1) Gauss Seidel method, i.e., simulation of scattering with radiation already scattered at the iteration stage, and (2) decrease of the spherical harmonics expansion order with the iteration order. Moreover, convergence towards the energetic equilibrium is accelerated with an exponential fitting technique. This model predicts the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of 3- D canopies. Radiation components associated with leaf volume and surface mechanisms are distinguished. It gives also the radiation regime within canopies, for further determination of 3-D photosynthesis rates and primary production. Accurate modeling of multiple scattering within cells, combined with the fact that cells can have different x,y,z dimensions, is well adapted to remote sensing based studies, i.e., scenes with large dimensions. The model was successfully tested with homogeneous covers. Preliminary comparisons of simulated reflectance images with remotely acquired spectral images of a 3-D heterogeneous forest cover stressed the usefulness of the DART model for conducting studies with remotely acquired information.},

abstract = {A methodology is proposed to analyze the radiative and thermal exchanges between a small urban neighborhood and the atmosphere based on the use of the thermoradiative model SOLENE and radiometric measurements to optimize the effective values of its constant parameters. Applied to the center of Toulouse, France, the optimization data are building surface temperatures measured with handheld radiometers and a downward-facing pyranometer during one of the intense observation periods of the CAnopy and Particles Interactions in TOulouse Urban Layer (CAPITOUL) experimental campaign. The quality of the simulations is assessed by comparing, without any other model adjustment, the model outputs for two diurnal cycles (1 day in summer and 1 day in winter) against two independent experimental datasets from fixed permanent radiometers and from sensors measuring the solar, infrared and sensible heat fluxes to the atmosphere at the top of a mast 30 m above the roofs. These simulations allow us to further analyze the separate contributions of the different surface classes, roofs, facades and pavement to these fluxes and to compare them with their counterparts observed over a neighborhood of Marseilles city center during a previous experiment. The partition is remarkably similar in Toulouse and Marseilles: 6–7% for the solar radiation, 73–76% for the infrared radiation and 17–20% for the sensible heat flux. The contribution of roofs to the infrared flux appears proportional to their plan area proportion (built density) but not the contributions to the other two fluxes. The contributions of facades to all three fluxes are roughly proportional to their fraction of the total surface area.},

abstract = {With 69% of the world's population predicted to live in cities by 2050, modification to local climates, in particular Urban Heat Islands (UHIs), have become a well studied phenomenon. However, few studies have considered how horizontal winds modify the spatial pattern in a process named Urban Heat Advection (UHA) and this is most likely due to a lack of highly spatially resolved observational data. For the first time, this study separates the two-dimensional advection-induced UHI component, including its pattern and magnitude, from the locally heated UHI component using a unique dataset of urban canopy temperatures from 29 weather stations (3 km resolution) recorded over 20 months in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The results show that the mean contribution of UHA to the warming of areas downwind of the city can be up to 1.2 °C. Using the inverse Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy for urban fraction, an upwind distance at which the urban fraction has the strongest correlation with UHA was demonstrated to be between 4 and 12 km. Overall, these findings suggest that urban planning and risk management needs to additionally consider UHA. However, more fundamentally, it highlights the importance of careful interpretation of long- term meteorological records taken near cities when they are used to assess global warming.},

abstract = {The urban thermal environment varies not only from its rural surroundings but also within the urban area due to intra-urban differences in land-use and surface characteristics. Understanding the causes of this intra-urban variability is a first step in improving urban planning and development. Toward this end, a method for quantifying causes of spatial variability in the urban heat island has been developed. This paper presents the method as applied to a specific test case of Portland, Oregon. Vehicle temperature traverses were used to determine spatial differences in summertime $\sim$2 m air temperature across the metropolitan area in the afternoon. A tree-structured regression model was used to quantify the land-use and surface characteristics that have the greatest influence on daytime UHI intensity. The most important urban characteristic separating warmer from cooler regions of the Portland metropolitan area was canopy cover. Roadway area density was also an important determinant of local UHI magnitudes. Specifically, the air above major arterial roads was found to be warmer on weekdays than weekends, possibly due to increased anthropogenic activity from the vehicle sector on weekdays. In general, warmer regions of the city were associated with industrial and commercial land-use. The downtown core, whilst warmer than the rural surroundings, was not the warmest part of the Portland metropolitan area. This is thought to be due in large part to local shading effects in the urban canyons.},

abstract = {In the modern era of urban climatology, much emphasis has been placed on observing and documenting heat island magnitudes in cities around the world. Urban climate literature consequently boasts a remarkable accumulation of observational heat island studies. Through time, however, methodologists have raised concerns about the authenticity of these studies, especially regarding the measurement, definition and reporting of heat island magnitudes. This paper substantiates these concerns through a systematic review and scientific critique of heat island literature from the period 1950-2007. The review uses nine criteria of experimental design and communication to critically assess methodological quality in a sample of 190 heat island studies. Results of this assessment are discouraging: the mean quality score of the sample is just 50 percent, and nearly half of all urban heat island magnitudes reported in the sample are judged to be scientifically indefensible. Two areas of universal weakness in the literature sample are controlled measurement and openness of method: one-half of the sample studies fail to sufficiently control the confounding effects of weather, relief or time on reported 'urban' heat island magnitudes, and three-quarters fail to communicate basic metadata regarding instrumentation and field site characteristics. A large proportion of observational heat island literature is therefore compromised by poor scientific practice. This paper concludes with recommendations for improving method and communication in heat island studies through better scrutiny of findings and more rigorous reporting of primary research. Copyright.

The code is easily used, runs quickly and provides the user with a wide variety of atmospheric models and options. Its spectral resolution is 20 1/cm Full Width/Half Maximum (FWHM) with calculations being done in 5 1/cm increments. This report describes work done to increase LOWTRAN's spectral resolution from 20 to 2 1/cm (FWHM). Specifically, the technical objectives for this program were: 1) to develop algorithms providing 2 1/cm resolution (FWHM); 2) to model molecular absorption of atmospheric molecules as a function of temperature and pressure; 3) to calculate band model parameters for twelve LOWTRAN molecular species; and 4) to integrate the LOWTRAN 7 capabilities into the new algorithms, maintaining compatibility with the multiple scattering option. MODTRAN, the final product of this effort, is a moderate resolution LOWTRAN code. Molecular absorption is calculated in 1 1/cm spectral bins, while the other parts of the calculation remain unchanged. The molecular species affected are: water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, methane, oxygen, nitric oxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and nitric acid.},

However direct measurements of land–atmosphere fluxes using the eddy-covariance method above lawn ecosystems are challenging due to the typically small dimensions of lawns and the heterogeneity of land use in an urbanised landscape. Given their typically small patch sizes, there is the potential that CO2 fluxes measured above turf-grass lawns may be influenced by nearby CO2 sources such as passing traffic. In this study, we report on two years of eddy-covariance flux measurements above a 1.5 ha turf-grass lawn in which we assess the contribution of nearby traffic emissions to the measured CO2 flux. We use winter data when the vegetation was dormant to develop an empirical estimate of the traffic effect on the measured CO2 fluxes, based on a parametrised version of a three-dimensional Lagrangian footprint model and continuous traffic count data. The CO2 budget of the ecosystem was adjusted by 135gCm−2 in 2007 and by 134gCm−2 in 2008 to determine the natural flux, even though the road crossed the footprint only at its far edge. We show that bottom-up flux estimates based on CO2 emission factors of the passing vehicles, combined with the crosswind-integrated footprint at the distance of the road, agreed very well with the empirical estimate of the traffic contribution that we derived from the eddy-covariance measurements. The approach we developed may be useful for other sites where investigators plan to make eddy-covariance measurements on small patches within heterogeneous landscapes where there are significant contrasts in flux rates. However, we caution that the modelling approach is empirical and will need to be adapted individually to each site.},

@article{Malek2006,
abstract = {Logan, Utah, USA, had the nation's worst air pollution on 15 January, 2004. The high concentration of PM2.5 (particulates smaller than 2.5 $\mu$m in diameter) in the air resulted from geographical, meteorological, and environmental aspects of Cache Valley. A strong inversion (increase of temperature with height) and light precipitation and/or wind were the major causes for trapping pollutants in the air. Other meteorological factors enhancing the inversion were: the prolonged high atmospheric surface pressure, a snow-covered surface which plunged temperatures to as low as - 23.6 °C on January 23rd and high reflection of solar radiation (up to about 80%), which caused less solar radiation absorption during the day throughout the most part of January 2004. Among non-meteorological factors are Cache Valley's small-basin geographical structure which traps air, with no big body of water to help the air circulation (as a result of differential heating and cooling rates for land and water), motor vehicle emissions, and existence of excess ammonia gas as a byproduct of livestock manure and urine. Concentration of PM2.5 was monitored in downtown Logan. On January 15, 2004, the 24-h, filter-based concentration reached about 132.5 $\mu$g per cubic meter of air, an astonishingly high value compared to the values of 65 $\mu$g m-3 and over, indicating a health alert for everyone. These tiny particles in the air have an enormous impact on health, aggravating heart and lung disease, triggering asthma and even death. The causes of this inversion and some suggestions to alleviate the wintertime particle concentration in Cache Valley will be addressed in this article. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Canadian urban and land surface external modeling system (known as urban GEM-SURF) has been developed to provide surface and near-surface meteorological variables to improve numerical weather prediction and to become a tool for environmental applications. The system is based on the Town Energy Balance model for the built-up covers and on the Interactions between the Surface, Biosphere, and Atmosphere land surface model for the natural covers. It is driven by coarse-resolution forecasts from the 15-km Canadian regional operational model. This new system was tested for a 120-m grid-size computational domain covering the Montreal metropolitan region from 1 May to 30 September 2008. The numerical results were first evaluated against local observations of the surface energy budgets, air temperature, and humidity taken at the Environmental Prediction in Canadian Cities (EPiCC) field experiment tower sites. As compared with the regional deterministic 15-km model, important improvements have been achieved with this system over urban and suburban sites. GEM-SURF's ability to simulate the Montreal surface urban heat island was also investigated, and the radiative surface temperatures from this system and from two systems operational at the Meteorological Service of Canada were compared, that is, the 15-km regional deterministic model and the so-called limited-area model with 2.5-km grid size. Comparison of urban GEM-SURF outputs with remotely sensed observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reveals relatively good agreement for urban and natural areas.

abstract = {Direct observations of urban surface temperature in daytime are made using a thermal scanner mounted in a helicopter over three land-use areas in Vancouver, B.C. The results reveal strong directional variations in the observed apparent surface temperature. The variations arise due to the differential patterns of irradiated and shaded surfaces within the sensor field of view created by the three-dimensional urban surface structure and the position of the Sun. The directional variations may be considered to be a form of effective anisotropy due to the large scale roughness of the urban surface. Variations in excess of 9 C were measured over a downtown area. Urban residential and light industrial land-use areas also exhibited strong effective anisotropy. The directional temperature variations are of similar magnitude to atmospheric corrections applied to thermal imagery. This implies that effective anisotropy should receive serious consideration in the interpretation of thermal imagery obtained over urban areas. The scale dependence of the effective anisotropy is discussed.},

abstract = {Measurements of thermal infrared (TIR) directional anisotropy (difference between off-nadir and nadir brightness temperatures) performed over the city of Toulouse using a method based on the use of 2 airborne TIR cameras are presented. Results from 3 flights at different times during a summer day (July 15th 2004) and from 1 flight in winter (February 25th 2005) all confirm important anisotropy (up to 10 ??C) and hot spot effects as previously reported in literature. A simple simulation approach is then proposed. It is based on the aggregation in any viewing direction of 6 directional temperatures (sunlit/shaded walls/streets/roofs) weighted by their corresponding surface ratios within the scene viewed. The city is described by 18 canyon streets oriented in all directions by 10?? steps and the 6 temperatures are determined by integrating simulations of the energy balance model SOLENE repeated for the 18 canyon streets. The surface ratios are computed from images of the studied area generated with the POV-Ray software (Persistence of Vison Raytracer, http://www.povray.org/). This method is described in detail. The modelled anisotropy compares favourably with the measurements on all dates, despite a systematic underestimation ranging between 15 and 30%. The possible sources of discrepancy including sensitivity to the aspect ratio and to the surface parameters and possible impact of microscale structures are briefly discussed and several improvements of the modelling system are suggested. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The cooling effects of urban parks, which form “Park Cool Island” (PCI), can help decrease land surface temperature (LST) and mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects. PCI intensity largely depends on the characteristics of urban parks. The relationship between PCI intensity and urban park characteristics such as urban park size has been well documented. However, it is still unclear how urban forest structures in parks affect PCI intensity and particularly whether the relationship changes across seasons. In this study, PCI intensity for 33 parks in Changchun, China was obtained from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data and then correlated with urban park characteristics such as the size derived from “Systeme Probatoire d'Observation dela Tarre” (SPOT) satellite data and the forest structures of parks derived from the field-based survey to uncover the relationship between urban park characteristics and PCI intensity. Our results suggested that (1) The PCI intensity varied across seasons and the cooling effect of parks in summer was higher than that in autumn. (2) The increase of urban park size was still an effective measure to mitigate UHI. However, urban park size was non-linearly correlated to PCI intensity. (3) Not only by increasing urban park size, but also by optimizing urban park shape and forest structures in parks can increase PCI intensity. (4) The relationship between PCI intensity and urban park characteristics changed across seasons and seasons should be considered when exploring the relationship between them. These findings can deepen the understanding of PCI formation and provide useful information for urban planners about how to design urban parks to maximize their PCI intensity and mitigate UHI effects.},

abstract = {‘Local climate zones' (LCZs) comprise a new and systematic classification of field sites for heat island studies. The classification divides urban and rural landscapes into 17 standard classes, each defined by structural and land cover properties that influence air temperature at screen height. This study is the first to evaluate the conceptual division of LCZs with temperature observations and simulation results from surface–atmosphere models. Results confirm that thermal contrasts exist among all LCZ classes, and that such contrasts are governed largely by building height and spacing, pervious surface fraction, tree density, and soil wetness. Therefore, partitioning of landscapes into structural and land cover classes, or ‘LCZs,' is deemed justified for the purposes of field site classification in heat island studies. Also justified is the use of inter-zone temperature difference (TLCZ X−Y) to quantify heat island magnitude. To further improve the LCZ system, we encourage other researchers to observe and model the climatic conditions of its varied classes. Especially useful would be tests using field data from different urban and rural environments to those in this study, and running more advanced urban canopy models with demonstrated predictive capability.},

abstract = {A consistent nomenclature for thermal infrared remote sensing of natural surfaces is outlined in this paper. Terms such as 'canopy temperature' and 'surface temperature' should be confined to general, qualitative descriptions and terms such as directional radiometric temperature, hemispherical emissivity, aerodynamic temperature, or hemispherical-directional reflectance used for technical precision. Some discussion also is included on the relation between hemispherical-directional thermal reflectance and directional thermal emissivity. A distinction is made between two kinds of emissivity; e-emissivity and r-emissivity. Through use of detailed models of directional thermal emissivity and bidirectional reflectance, we suggest that the influence of temperature gradients in vegetation on directional emissivity usually will cause uncertainties of less than 0.005. In addition, uncertainties that occur in estimating surface temperature, which arise because an ensemble of black bodies each at a different temperature does not have a black body radiance distribution with temperature, will not always be negligible for purposes of remote sensing of natural surfaces. Differences between mean thermodynamic and ensemble radiometric temperatures of 1 K or larger are possible even though differences in ensemble radiometric temperatures for different wavelength bands in the atmospheric window (8-14 ??m) usually will be less than 0.1 K. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The temporal and spatial distributions of boundary-layer ozone were studied during June 2000 at Summit, Greenland, using surface-level measurements and vertical profiling from a tethered balloon platform. Three weeks of continuous ozone surface data, 133 meteorological vertical profile data and 82 ozone vertical profile data sets were collected from the surface to a maximum altitude of 1400m above ground. The lower atmosphere at Summit was characterized by the prevalence of strong stable conditions with strong surface temperature inversions. These inversions reversed to neutral to slightly unstable conditions betweenB9.00 and 18.00 h local time with the formation of shallow mixing heights of B70–250m above the surface. The surface ozone mixing ratio ranged from 39 to 68 ppbv and occasionally had rapid changes of up to 20ppb in 12 h. The diurnal mean ozone mixing ratio showed diurnal trends indicating meteorological and photochemical controls of surface ozone. Vertical profiles were within the range of 37–76ppb and showed strong stratification in the lower troposphere. A high correlation of high ozone/low water vapor air masses indicated the transport of high tropospheric/ low stratospheric air into the lower boundary layer. AB0.1–3 ppb decline of the ozone mixing ratio towards the surface was frequently observed within the neutrally stable mixed layer during midday hours. These data suggest that the boundary-layer ozone mixing ratio and ozone depletion and deposition to the snowpack are influenced by photochemical processes and/or transport phenomena that follow diurnal dependencies. With 37 ppb of ozone being the lowest mixing ratio measured in all data no evidence was seen for the occurrence of ozone depletion episodes similar to those that have been reported within the boundary layer at coastal Arctic sites during springtime.},

Primarily using a complementary set of difference measures, both model accuracy and precision can be meaningfully estimated, regardless of whether the model predictions are manifested as scalars, directions, or vectors. It is additionally suggested that the reliability of the accuracy and precision measures can be determined from bootstrap estimates of confidence and significance. Recommended procedures are illustrated with a comparative evaluation of two models that estimate wind velocity over the South Atlantic Bight.},

abstract = {Longwave radiative flux divergence within the lowest 50 m of the atmospheric\nboundary layer was observed during the Eidgen{\"{o}}ssische Technische\nHochschule (ETH) Greenland Summit experiment. The dataset collected\nat 72�35\primeN, 38�30\primeW, 3203 m MSL is based on longwave\nradiation measurements at 2 and 48 m that are corrected for the influence\nof the supporting tower structure. The observations cover all seasons\nand reveal the magnitude of longwave radiative flux divergence and\nits incoming and outgoing component under stable and unstable conditions.\nLongwave radiative flux divergence during winter corresponds to a\nradiative cooling of -10 K day-1, but values of -30 K day-1 can persist\nfor several days. During summer, the mean cooling effect of longwave\nradiative flux divergence is small (-2 K day-1) but exhibits a strong\ndiurnal cycle. With values ranging from -35 K day-1 around midnight\nto 15 K day-1 at noon, the heating rate due to longwave radiative\nflux divergence is of the same order of magnitude as the observed\ntemperature tendency. However, temperature tendency and longwave\nradiative flux divergence are out of phase, with temperature tendency\nleading the longwave radiative flux divergence by 3 h. The vertical\nvariation of the outgoing longwave flux usually dominates the net\nlongwave flux divergence, showing a strong divergence at nighttime\nand a strong convergence during the day. The divergence of the incoming\nlongwave flux plays a secondary role, showing a slight counteracting\neffect. Fog is frequently observed during summer nights. Under such\nconditions, a divergence of both incoming and outgoing fluxes leads\nto the strongest radiative cooling rates that are observed. Considering\nall data, a correlation between longwave radiative flux divergence\nand the temperature difference across the 2--48-m layer is found.},

This paper presents an approach to quantifying some of these uncertainties within a probabilistic framework. A hierarchical impact model is developed that addresses uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions, the climate sensitivity, and limitations and unpredictability in general circulation models. The hierarchical model is used in Bayesian Monte-Carlo simulations to define posterior probability distri- butions for changes in seasonal-mean temperature and precipitation over the United Kingdom that are conditional on prior distributions for the model parameters. The application of this approach to an impact model is demonstrated using a hydrological example.},

abstract = {The modeling and prediction of the stable boundary layer over land is a persistent, problematic feature in weather. climate, and air quality topics. Here, the performance of a state-of-the-art single-column boundary layer model is evaluated with observations from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99) field experiment. Very high model resolution in the atmosphere and the soil is utilized to represent three different stable boundary layer archetypes, namely, a fully turbulent night, an intermittently turbulent night, and a radiative night with hardly any turbulence (all at clear skies). Each archetype represents a different class of atmospheric stability. In the current model, the atmosphere is fully coupled to a vegetation layer and the underlying soil. In addition, stability functions (local scaling) are utilized based on in situ observations. Overall it is found that the vertical structure, the surface fluxes (apart from the intermittent character) and the surface temperature in the stable boundary layer can be satisfactorily modeled for a broad stability range (at a local scale) with the current understanding of the physics of the stable boundary layer. This can also be achieved by the use of a rather detailed coupling between the atmosphere and the underlying soil and vegetation, together with high resolution in both the atmosphere and the soil. This is especially true for the very stable nights, when longwave radiative cooling is dominant. Both model outcome and observations show that in the latter case the soil heat flux is a dominant term of the surface energy budget.},

abstract = {We have lived under the hegemony of the reductionistic scientific worldview since Galileo, Newton, and Laplace. In this view, the universe is meaningless, as Stephen Weinberg famously said, and organisms and a court of law are "nothing but" particles in morion. This scientific view is inadequate. Physicists are beginning to abandon reductionism in favor of emergence. Emergence, both epistemological and ontological, embraces the emergence of life and of agency. With agency comes meaning, value, and doing, beyond mere happenings. More organisms are conscious. None of this violates any laws of physics, but it cannot be reduced to physics. Emergence is real, and the tiger chasing the gazelle are real parts of the real universe. We live, therefore, in an emergent universe. This emergence often is entirely unpredictable beforehand, from the evolution of novel functionalities in organisms to the evolution of the economy and human history. We are surrounded on all sides by a creativity that cannot even be prestated. Thus we have the first glimmerings of a new scientific worldview, beyond reductionism. In our universe emergence is real, and there is ceaseless, stunning creativity that has given rise to our biosphere, our humanity, and our history. We are partial co-creators of this emergent creativity. It is our choice whether we use the God word. I believe it is wise to do so. God can be our shared name for the true creativity in the natural universe. Such a view invites a new sense of the sacred, as those aspects of the creativity in the universe that we deem worthy of holding sacred. We are not logically forced to this view. Yet a global civilization, hopefully persistently diverse and creative, is emerging. I believe we need a shared view of God, a fully natural God, to orient our lives. We need a shared view of the sacred that is open to slow evolution, because rigidity in our view of the sacred violates how our most precious values evolve and invites ethical hegemony. We need a shared global ethic beyond our materialism. I believe a sense of God as the natural, awesome creativity in the universe can help us construct the sacred and a global ethic to help shape the global civilization toward what we choose with the best of our limited wisdom.},

abstract = {A unique set of nocturnal longwave radiative and sensible heat flux divergences was obtained during the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99). These divergences are based on upward and downward longwave radiation measurements at two levels and turbulent eddy correlation measurements at eight levels. In contrast to previous radiation divergence measurements obtained within 10 m above the ground, radiative flux divergence was measured within a deeper layer-between 2 and 48 m. Within the layer, the radiative flux divergence is, on average, comparable to or smaller than the sensible heat flux divergence. The horizontal and vertical temperature advection, derived as the residual in the heat balance using observed sensible heat and radiative fluxes, are found to be significant terms in the heat balance at night. The observations also indicate that the radiative flux divergence between 2 and 48 m was typically largest in the early evening. Its magnitude depends on how fast the ground cools and on how large the vertical temperature gradient is within the layer. A radiative flux difference of more than 10 W m(-2) over 46 m of height was observed under weak-wind and clear-sky conditions after hot days. Wind speed variation can change not only the sensible heat transfer but also the surface longwave radiation because of variations of the area exposure of the warmer grass stems and soil surfaces versus the cooler grass blade tips, leading to fluctuations of the radiative flux divergence throughout the night.},

abstract = {The UK policy change from 'flood defence' to 'flood risk management' in the 1990s has involved shifts to more distributed flood risk management responsibilities. This poses questions about roles of floodplain residents in community-led adaptation planning for changing flood risk, and how these roles can be supported/strengthened. Research evidence emphasises importance of informal/local/lay knowledge, 'watery sense of place', flood memories and shared flood heritage, in how communities prepare for, and recover from, floods. This paper outlines initial research outcomes from an interdisciplinary UK Economic and Social Research Council-funded research project that proposes the concept of 'sustainable flood memory' in the context of effective flood risk management. This is conceived as an approach to memory work that is community focused, archival, integrating individual and collective experiences, involving inter- and intra-generational communication, and strategies for its future. The project aims to increase understanding of how flood memories provide a platform for developing informal knowledge, so creating social learning opportunities in communities that can increase their adaptive capacities and flood resilience. It explores: how communities remember and archive flood experiences; how local flood knowledge is materialised, assimilated and protected; the role of catastrophic floods (e.g. July 2007, River Severn, UK) in building 'community' memory and flood risk knowledge; and whether informal knowledge is tacit or otherwise, if and how it is learned, and whether it can be transmitted, developed, revitalised and returned in settings where it is lost or lacking. {\textcopyright} 2012 WIT Press.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of atmospheric attenuation on surface radiative temperatures obtained by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over a tallgrass prairie area in the Flint HIlls of Kansas. We used six atmospheric correction models developed primarily for sea-surface temperature studies to test their utility for retrieval of radiative temperatures over the land surface. The analysis included an assessment of uncertainties associated with in situ and AVHRR data. We found an uncertainty of ?? 3.0??C forthe AVHRR data, and used this limit to evaluate the performance of a given model. When the difference between in situ and AVHRR surface temperatures was smaller than the uncertainty, the model was judged to be adequate. Among the six model evaluated, only the NOAA split-window model consistently adjusted the AVHRR surface temperatures within ?? 3.0??C of the in situ measurements. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of inversion-layer breakup in idealized steep valleys are performed using the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) to investigate the effects of valley width and depth, and topographic shade. Simulations of the diurnal pattern of slope winds under weak synoptic conditions are presented in a valley of depth 500 m and floor width 1200 m. Typical up- and downslope wind circulations are reproduced, and their influence on the stability in the valley is analyzed and characterized using the classifications of Whiteman. A systematic investigation of the inversion- layer characteristics in a set of 24 valleys of varying depth and width is conducted. For the narrow-valley cases, the depth and lifetime of the stable layer increase as the depth of the valley increases. For wide valleys, however, the stable-layer depth and lifetime converge toward a single value regardless of the valley depth. An original subroutine accounting for topographic shading is introduced and its effects on both the slope winds and the inversion breakup process are discussed. Results from tests in idealized valleys indicate that topographic shading can delay inversion- layer breakup and, therefore, should be included, when appropriate, in numerical simulations of flow over complex terrain.},

Big data also, however, poses a number of challenges and risks to geographic scholarship and raises a number of taxing epistemological, methodological and ethical questions.

abstract = {A neighbourhood-scale multi-layer urban canopy model of shortwave and longwave radiation exchange that explicitly includes the radiative effects of tall vegetation (trees) is presented. Tree foliage is permitted both between and above buildings, and mutual shading, emission and reflection between buildings and trees are included. The basic geometry is a two-dimensional canyon with leaf area density profiles and probabilistic variation of building height. Furthermore, the model accounts for three-dimensional path lengths through the foliage. Ray tracing determines the receipt of direct shortwave irradiance by building and foliage elements. View factors for longwave and shortwave diffuse radiation exchange are computed once at the start of the simulation using a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach; for subsequent model timesteps, matrix inversion rapidly solves infinite reflections and interception of emitted longwave between all elements. The model is designed to simulate any combination of shortwave and longwave radiation frequency bands, and to be portable to any neighbourhood-scale urban canopy geometry based on the urban canyon. Additionally, the model is sufficiently flexible to represent forest and forest-clearing scenarios. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate the model is robust and computationally feasible, and highlight the importance of vertical resolution to the performance of urban canopy radiation models. Full model evaluation is limited by the paucity of within-canyon radiation measurements in urban neighbourhoods with trees. Where appropriate model components are tested against analytic relations and results from an independent urban radiation transfer model. Furthermore, system response tests demonstrate the ability of the model to realistically distribute shortwave radiation among urban elements as a function of built form, solar angle and tree foliage height, density and clumping. Separate modelling of photosynthetically-active and near-infrared shortwave bands is shown to be important in some cases. Increased canyon height-to-width ratio and/or tree cover diminishes the net longwave radiation loss of individual canyon elements (e.g., floor, walls), but, notably, has little effect on the net longwave loss of the whole urban canopy. When combined with parametrizations for the impacts of trees on airflow and hydrological processes in the urban surface layer, the new radiation model extends the applicability of urban canopy models and permits more robust assessment of trees as tools to manage urban climate, air quality, human comfort and building energy loads.},

abstract = {A small, but growing, number of flux towers in urban environments measure surface-atmospheric exchanges of carbon dioxide by the eddy covariance method. As in all eddy covariance studies, obtaining annual sums of urban CO2 exchange requires imputation of data gaps due to low turbulence and non-stationary conditions, adverse weather, and instrument failures. Gap-filling approaches that are widely used for measurements from towers in natural vegetation are based on light and temperature response models. However, they do not account for key features of the urban environment including tower footprint heterogeneity and localized CO2 sources. Here, we present a novel gap-filling modeling framework that uses machine learning to select explanatory variables, such as continuous traffic counts and temporal variables, and then constrains models separately for spatially classified subsets of the data. We applied the modeling framework to a three year time series of measurements from a tall broadcast tower in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. The gap-filling performance was similar to that reported for natural measurement sites, explaining 64% to 88% of the variability in the fluxes. Simulated carbon budgets were in good agreement with an ecophysiological bottom-up study at the same site. Total annual carbon dioxide flux sums for the tower site ranged from 1064 to 1382gCm-2yr-1, across different years and different gap-filling methods. Bias errors of annual sums resulting from gap-filling did not exceed 18gCm-2yr-1 and random uncertainties did not exceed ??44gCm-2yr-1 (or ??3.8% of the annual flux). Regardless of the gap-filling method used, the year-to-year differences in carbon exchange at this site were small. In contrast, the modeled annual sums of CO2 exchange differed by a factor of two depending on wind direction. This indicated that the modeled time series captured the spatial variability in both the biogenic and anthropogenic CO2 sources and sinks in a reproducible way. The gap-filling approach developed here may also be useful for inhomogeneous sites other than urban areas, such as logged forests or ecosystems under disturbance from fire or pests.},

We use atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration as a single, simple indicator to track the progression of the Anthropocene. From a preindustrial value of 270-275 ppm, atmospheric carbon dioxide had risen to about 310 ppm by 1950. Since then the human enterprise has experienced a remarkable explosion, the Great Acceleration, with significant consequences for Earth System functioning. Atmospheric CO2 concentration has risen from 310 to 380 ppm since 1950, with about half of the total rise since the preindustrial era occurring in just the last 30 years. The Great Acceleration is reaching criticality. Whatever unfolds, the next few decades will surely be a tipping point in the evolution of the Anthropocene.},

abstract = {Urban heat island is among the most evident aspects of human impacts on the earth system. Here we assess the diurnal and seasonal variation of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) defined as the surface temperature difference between urban area and suburban area measured from the MODIS. Differences in SUHII are analyzed across 419 global big cities, and we assess several potential biophysical and socio-economic driving factors. Across the big cities, we show that the average annual daytime SUHII (1.5 ± 1.2 °C) is higher than the annual nighttime SUHII (1.1 ± 0.5 °C) (P < 0.001). But no correlation is found between daytime and nighttime SUHII across big cities (P = 0.84), suggesting different driving mechanisms between day and night. The distribution of nighttime SUHII correlates positively with the difference in albedo and nighttime light between urban area and suburban area, while the distribution of daytime SUHII correlates negatively across cities with the difference of vegetation cover and activity between urban and suburban areas. Our results emphasize the key role of vegetation feedbacks in attenuating SUHII of big cities during the day, in particular during the growing season, further highlighting that increasing urban vegetation cover could be one effective way to mitigate the urban heat island effect.},

abstract = {Better communication both within the field of urban climate and between urban climate and cognate fields is necessary to both bind the subject internally and to more effectively move it into interdisciplinary interaction. A brief statement of the wide diversity of the field and its several modes of study and application leads to the view that it would be beneficial to consider adopting aids to increase dialogue. This includes standardization of sym- bols, terminology and indices, classification of phenomena, a protocol to generalize site description, adoption of principles of experimental design and the use of dimen- sional analysis and normalization to aid the transferability of results. The focus of this paper is how to facilitate scientific inter- action between participants within the field of urban climate, including both those who study its mechanisms and effects and those who apply such knowledge to the improvement of human settlements. As a by-product it may also assist com- munication between urban climatologists and workers in cognate fields as well as those we wish to entrain in the fields of policy development and environmental manage- ment. Section 1 explains the nature of the urban climate field and its practitioners, especially the diversity of scholarly disciplines, the range of topics studied and the motivations for doing so. Section 2 describes the sequence of investi- gative modes associated with achieving coherent understand- ing and intelligent application of urban climate. Section 3 attempts to outline some essential elements which might promote discourse between these modes such as the use of a common set of symbols and terminology and ways of expressing results so as to standardize variables and thereby assist comparison and transferability of results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Winter temperature inversions-layers of air in which temperature increases with altitude-trap air pollutants and lead to higher pollutant concentrations. Previous studies have evaluated associations between pollutants and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, but none have considered inversions as independent risk factors for ED visits for asthma. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess associations between winter inversions and ED visits for asthma in Salt Lake County, Utah. METHODS: We obtained electronic records of ED visits for asthma and data on inversions, weather, and air pollutants for Salt Lake County, Utah, during the winters of 2003 through 2004 to 2007 through 2008. We identified 3,425 ED visits using a primary diagnosis of asthma. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design, and conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate rate ratios of ED visits for asthma in relation to inversions during a 4-day lag period and prolonged inversions. We evaluated interactions between inversions and weather and pollutants. RESULTS: After adjusting for dew point and mean temperatures, the OR for ED visits for asthma associated with inversions 0-3 days before the visit compared with no inversions during the lag period was 1.14 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.30). The OR for each 1-day increase in the number of inversion days during the lag period was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07). Associations were only apparent when PM10 and maximum and mean temperatures were above median levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that winter inversions are associated with increased rates of ED visits for asthma.},

abstract = {We examined the horizontal and vertical noctur- nal cooling influence of a small park with irrigated lawn and xeric surfaces (∼3 ha) within a university campus of a hot arid city. Temperature data from 0.01- to 3-m heights observed during a bicycle traverse of the campus were combined with modeled spatial temperature data simulated from a three-dimensional microclimate model (ENVI-met 3.1). A distinct park cool island, with mean observed magnitudes of 0.7–3.6°C, was documented for both traverse and model data with larger cooling intensities measured closer to surface level. Modeled results possessed varying but generally reasonable accuracy in simulating both spatial and temporal temperature data, although some systematic errors exist. A combination of several factors, such as variations in surface thermal properties, urban geometry, building orientation, and soil moisture, was likely responsible for influencing differential urban and non-urban near-surface temperatures. A strong inversion layer up to 1 m over non-urban surfaces was detected, contrasting with near-neutral lapse rates over urban sur- faces. A key factor in the spatial expansion of the park cool island was the advection of cooler park air to adjacent urban surfaces, although this effect was mostly concentrated from 0- to 1-m heights over urban surfaces that were more exposed to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Enhanced aeolian supply of iron to the biota of the Southern Ocean during glacial periods is suspected to be an important contributory mechanism to the concurrently low observed mixing ratios of atmospheric CO2. Declining rates of dust deposition prior to the glacial terminations may be critical in driving the initial deglacial rise in CO2, but the reasons behind the dust decline itself are as yet unknown. Here we show that the dust record from the Vostok ice core can be qualitatively derived from a few general assumptions regarding the formation and aging of Patagonian sources of aeolian material and the efficiency with which it is transported through the atmosphere. We suggest that during glacial periods this dust supply becomes particularly sensitive to changes in global climate and that, in turn, climate is responsive to the dust due to iron fertilization. This positive feedback may mean that during glacial periods the carbon cycle exhibits two quasi steady states, characterized by distinct CO2 concentrations. Recognition of this “glacial subcycle” may help to account for the timing and sequence of events at the terminations.},

abstract = {Longwave radiation flux, an important part of the surface heat budget, is generally represented by ????Tr
4, where ?? is the surface emissivity, ?? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and Tr is the measured radiometric temperature. ????Tr
4 differs from hemispheric emission because the measured radiometric temperature is anisotropic for an uneven surface. This paper analyzes the anisotropy-related error in measurements of longwave radiation flux from a building canopy. The flux difference between ????Tr
4 and directly measured flux was up to 8% of the directly measured flux, which could be greater than the typical error in measurement of turbulent heat flux over a building canopy. The flux difference increased as the temperature variation within the urban street canyon increased, and also with increasing difference between the incident solar radiation of the building walls and street canyon floors (pavement, roads, ground surface). Theoretical calculations indicate that the flux difference is due to the structure of the building canopy and the temperature difference between the walls and canopy floors. A numerical model of a building canopy heat budget shows that the flux difference increases as the street canyon aspect ratio increases. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cities create their own microclimates and their sites are almost always warmer, compared to a nearby rural location, than if the city were not there. The effect on temperatures measured in the city has been termed the 'urban heat island' (UHI). In this study we assess the strength of the UHI within and around London based on monthly and seasonal maximum, mean and minimum temperatures. The purpose of the study is not to look at UHI extremes on individually conducive days, but to show that the effect has a certain magnitude on monthly and seasonal averages, and assess whether this magnitude of UHI for Central London has increased over the twentieth century compared to rural locations around London (Jones et al., 2008). London is possibly the longest-studied UHI of any city; Luke Howard (1833) was probably the first scientist to suggest that the temperature recorded in a city was likely to be higher than that in the surrounding countryside. The major studies of urban-related warming in London since then have all recognized the importance of homo-geneous temperature series and the need to look at long time series, as opposed to the effects on individual days or short peri-ods. Moffitt (1972) compared the long Kew (KEW) record with that from Rothamsted (ROTH), remarking that this rural site is unlikely to be affected by any development at Harpenden (a mile to the northeast of the site). A study was conducted (in 1925) con-cerning a site move that took place in 1915. Although the study is no longer available, a letter in the station metadata files states that there was good agreement between readings at the two sites and that there was no regular pattern in the minor variations (Moffitt, 1972). Some additional discussion of this site move is given by Tyrrell (1972) and Moffitt (1973). ROTH is used as one of the three key sites in England for the Central England Temperature (CET) series, and no adjustments to its data have been made (Parker et al., 1992). Moffitt (1972) concluded that KEW warmed relative to ROTH between 1878 and 1968 by about 0.8 degC, slightly more in winter and summer and slightly less in spring and autumn. Moffitt (1972) also showed that KEW (for annual aver-age temperature) was warmer than ROTH in the 1880s by 0.74 degC, which agreed well with the height difference (123 metres) between the stations, assuming a standard lapse rate of 0.6 degC per 100 metres. This value will be important later when we assess the magnitude of Central London's UHI. We will also assess whether this value should be applied equally to maximum and minimum temperatures. Later work by Lee (1992) and Wilby (2003) used the more central London site of St James's Park (SJP) and replaced the ROTH rural record with Wisley (WIS). The periods of record were reduced to 1962–1989 and 1958–1998, respectively, and the empha-sis changed to the magnitude of UHI. Lee (1992) considered whether the urban-related warming trend had increased over his period of analysis, but was only able to find that minimum temperatures had risen while maxima decreased at SJP compared to WIS with no overall change in mean tem-peratures. Wilby (2003) found similar results to Lee (1992) and correlated counts of daily extreme UHI values (SJP warmer than WIS by more than 4 degC) against a number of synoptic indices. In this study we will use an additional site in Central London (London Weather Centre, LWC) and one in a more suburban location (Heathrow Airport, LHR), and use the full length of digitally available daily and monthly average records.},

Results are compared with a regression ´dz model based on incoming solar radiation and with an urban canopy-layer model incorporating a canyon geometry radiation scheme that requires a larger set of meteorological and surface property inputs. This net all-wave radiation parameterization (NARP) is most sensitive to albedo and the effects of clouds on incoming longwave radiation. Although omitting the diurnal variation of albedo has little impact on overall model fit, its seasonal variability needs to be considered in some cases. For incoming longwave radiation, even clear-sky estimates show a large degree of scatter, and results degrade substantially if cloudy periods are included. NARP shows improvement over the regression approach. If observations of downwelling longwave radiation are included, NARP and the more complex canopy scheme show similar results, near or within the range of instrument error, depending of time of year. 1.},

abstract = {Mitigation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect at the city-scale is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in conjunction with the Princeton Urban Canopy Model (PUCM). Specifically, the cooling impacts of green roof and cool (white/highalbedo) roof strategies over the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area during a heat wave period (7 June–10 June 2008) are assessed using the optimal set-up of WRF-PUCM described in the companion paper by Li and Bou-Zeid (2014). Results indicate that the surface UHI effect (defined based on the urban–rural surface temperature difference) is reduced significantly more than the near-surface UHI effect (defined based on urban–rural 2 m air temperature difference) when these mitigation strategies are adopted. In addition, as the green and cool roof fractions increase, the surface and near-surface UHIs are reduced almost linearly. Green roofs with relatively abundant soil moisture have comparable effect in reducing the surface and near-surface UHIs to cool roofs with an albedo value of 0.7. Significant indirect effects are also observed for both green and cool roof strategies; mainly, the low-level advection of atmospheric moisture from rural areas into urban terrain is enhanced when the fraction of these roofs increases, thus increasing the humidity in urban areas. The additional benefits or penalties associated with modifications of the main physical determinants of green or cool roof performance are also investigated. For green roofs, when the soil moisture is increased by irrigation, additional cooling effect is obtained, especially when the ‘unmanaged' soil moisture is low. The effects of changing the albedo of cool roofs are also substantial. These results also underline the capabilities of the WRF-PUCM framework to support detailed analysis and diagnosis of the UHI phenomenon, and of its different mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {The effect of urban development on local thermal climate is ostensibly well documented in scientific literature. Since the nineteenth century, observations of “urban-rural” air temperature differences ($\Delta$Tu­-r), or urban heat island magnitudes, have been reported for hundreds of cities worldwide. The historical and geographical scope of the heat island literature is impressive. Over time, however, methodologists have raised concerns about the rigor and authenticity of that literature, especially regarding the definition, measurement, and reporting of heat island magnitudes. Indiscriminate use of “urban” and “rural” by heat island investigators to describe their field sites is a particular concern. Much confusion now surrounds the physical and cultural characteristics of so-called urban and rural sites in heat island literature. This thesis confronts these concerns through two approaches. The first approach synthesizes and evaluates a sample of 190 observational heat island studies from the period 1950 to 2007. The synthesis uses nine criteria of scientific method and communication to critically assess the experimental quality of each study. Results are discouraging: the mean quality score of the literature sample is just 50 percent, and nearly one-half of the reported heat island magnitudes are judged to be scientifically indefensible on account of incomplete or incompetent reporting. The second approach develops a landscape classification system to standardize reporting of heat island field sites and temperatures in all cities. The local climate zone (LCZ) system comprises 17 zones and is the first comprehensive climate-based classification of urban and rural landscapes for heat island investigators. Each zone represents an area that is local in scale and unique in land cover, building morphology, and screen-level thermal climate. Results show that the new classification leads to a more purposeful interpretation of heat island magnitude as $\Delta$TLCZ, and thereby constrains the operational use of $\Delta$Tu­-r to climatologically defined and universally recognized urban and rural zones. The thesis concludes with a conceptual typology of urban heat island magnitudes, and a list of specific guidelines and recommendations to improve methodology and communication in heat island studies.},

This paper outlines two versions of a numerical model to describe the cooling of rural and street canyon surfaces under these conditions using surface thermal and radiative properties and the radiative geometry of the canyons. One version uses a full system of differential equations and the other the simpler force-restore approach. The two approaches are shown to be in general agreement and the output of the simpler model is shown to give a faithful representation of cooling of rural and urban surfaces. and therefore heat islands. when compared with field observations. 1.},

abstract = {Thermal remote sensing has been used over urban areas to assess the urban heat island, to perform land cover classifications and as input for models of urban surface atmosphere exchange. Here, we review the use of thermal remote sensing in the study of urban climates, focusing primarily on the urban heat island effect and progress made towards answering the methodological questions posed by Roth et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 10 (1989) 1699]. The review demonstrates that while some progress has been made, the thermal remote sensing of urban areas has been slow to advance beyond qualitative description of thermal patterns and simple correlations. Part of the difficulty lies in the tendency to use qualitatively based land use data to describe the urban surface rather than the use of more fundamental surface descriptors. Advances in the application of thermal remote sensing to natural and agricultural surfaces suggest insight into possible methods to advance techniques and capabilities over urban areas. Improvements in the spatial and spectral resolution of current and next-generation satellite-based sensors, in more detailed surface representations of urban surfaces and in the availability of low cost, high resolution portable thermal scanners are expected to allow progress in the application of urban thermal remote sensing to the study of the climate of urban areas. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents an urban canopy and building energy model based on a thermal network of constant resistances and capacitances. The RC model represents the fundamental physical relations that govern the energy interactions between buildings and their urban environment, retaining the sensitivity to the design parameters typically used in building energy and urban climate studies. The benefits of the RC model are its simplicity and computational efficiency. It allows for better understanding the physics of the problem and makes it possible to easily evaluate modelling hypotheses and the sensitivity of different parameters. In this study, the RC model is evaluated against advanced simulation tools that are well accepted and evaluated within their individual scientific communities. The model is then used in a series of parametric analyses to investigate the impact of the Urban Heat Island effect on the energy consumption of buildings in configurations that are parameterized in terms of internal heat gains, construction, geometry, glazing ratio, and infiltration level. The RC model is also used to investigate the dominant mechanisms by which the indoor environment affects outdoor air temperatures. Parameters such as indoor air temperatures, exfiltration heat, and waste heat from HVAC systems are analysed. The conclusions obtained by this study can be applied to a wide range of urban configurations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Montreal Urban Snow Experiment was dedicated to furthering the understanding of micrometeorological processes involved in the late winter-early spring transition period in a Canadian city. A surface energy budget (SEB) measurement site was installed in a dense residential area of Montreal for several weeks in 2005 and 2006. This paper focuses on the last 6 days of the 2006 experiment (23-28 March 2006), after snowmelt and before vegetation became active, with the objectives of providing a better understanding of physical processes involved during this transition period and examining their impact on the SEB. The Town Energy Balance urban canopy model and the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere force-restore land surface model are used in stand-alone mode and are forced with meteorological data measured at the top of a 20-m AGL instrumented tower. Preliminary results reveal deficiencies in the models' ability to simulate the surface energy budget partitioning, and in particular show overestimation of the sensible heat flux. Sensitivity studies indicate that a large portion of these problems is related to the latent heat transfer involved in natural soil freeze/thaw processes, which has a significant effect on the surface energy budget in this urban area. It is also found that the SEB in this particular situation is very sensitive to the thermal roughness length used for local energy exchange over the roof and road surfaces. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Whilst the measurement of radiation emissions from a surface is relatively straightforward, correct interpretation and proper utilization of the information requires that the surface area 'seen' be known accurately. This becomes non-trivial when the target is an urban surface, due to its complex three-dimensional form and the different thermal, radiative and moisture properties of its myriad surface facets. The geometric structure creates shade patterns in combination with the solar beam and obscures portions of the surface from the sensor, depending on where it is pointing and its field-of-view (FOV). A model to calculate these surface-sensor-sun relations (SUM) is described. SUM is tested against field and scale model observations, and theoretical calculations, and found to perform well. It can predict the surface area 'seen' by a sensor of known FOV pointing in any direction when placed at any point in space above a specified urban surface structure. Moreover, SUM can predict the view factors of the roof, wall and ground facets 'seen' and whether they are sunlit or shaded at any location and time of day. SUM can be used to determine the optimal placement and orientation of remote sensors to study urban radiation emissions; if the facet temperatures are known or modelled it can calculate the average temperature of the system, and it can determine the directional variation of temperature (anisotropy) due to any particular surface-sensor-sun geometric combination. The present surface geometry used in SUM is relatively simple, but there is scope to make it increasingly realistic.},

abstract = {Summary  During the Basel Urban Boundary Layer Experiment (BUBBLE) conducted in 2002, micrometeorological in-situ data were collected for different sites using a variety of instruments. This provides a unique data set for urban climate studies. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of energy and heat fluxes can only be taken into account with remote sensing methods or numerical models. Therefore, multiple satellite images from different platforms (NOAA-AVHRR, MODIS and LANDSAT ETM+) were acquired, processed and analysed. In addition, a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and a 1 m resolution digital surface model (DSM) of a large part of the city of Basel was utilized. This paper focuses on the calculation and modelling of the ground (or storage) heat flux density using remotely sensed data combined with in-situ measurements using three different approaches. First, an empirical regression function was generated to estimate the storage heat flux from NDVI values second approach used the Objective Hysteresis Model (OHM) which is often used for in-situ measurements. The last method used information of the geometric parameters of urban street canyons, computed from the high resolution digital urban surface model. Modelled and measured data are found to be in agreement within �30 Wm−2 and result in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95.},

abstract = {Temporal aspects of the urban heat island (UHI) of Vancouver, British Columbia, are demonstrated using differences of screen-level air temperature observed at an urban (downtown) and rural (farmland) site for three years. On an annual basis, the UHI is at its maximum near the middle of the night and its minimum is in mid-afternoon. Growth of the nocturnal UHI is driven by rural cooling rates in the early evening, which are much greater than the almost constant rates in the city. Growth starts earlier in winter. The largest UHI occurs in the fall, and the smallest in the spring. In daytime there is often a "cool island," especially in summer. There is an approximately inverse square root control of the UHI by wind speed and the effect of cloud type and amount follows the Bolt relation. Combining the two gives a "weather factor" that is linearly related to maximum UHI magnitude. Seasonal variation of the UHI is shown to be inversely related to the thermal admittance of the rural site, which itself is controlled largely by soil moisture status. This is done by calculating a "potential" UHI that is free of weather effects; a value that approximately conforms to that predicted by the SHIM numerical model. Surface wetting caused by recent rain, fog, or melting snow also is found to reduce UHI magnitude. While not quantified, marine advective effects appear to modify the UHI, especially the summer daytime cool island.},

abstract = {Sustainable development can be defined as that which meets the needs of the current generation while leaving sufficient resources for the needs of future generations. A central objective is to decouple conventional resource use (and its corollary, waste generation) from economic development through technological innovation, improved efficiency and changes in individual practices. As the global population becomes urbanized and human activity is concentrated in urban areas, settlement planning is a key aspect of sustainability. The widespread inclusion of environmental objectives in urban plans at all scales provides an opportunity for the incorporation of urban climate knowledge into the planning process on a routine basis. Many of the stated objectives have both direct and indirect connections to climate. However, for this to happen, climate research and results must be linked more explicitly to the objectives of the sustainable settlement. In this paper, the relevance of sustainability to urban design and climate is discussed and the potential contribution of current urban climatology is assessed, identifying areas of special consideration for transfer to achieve sustainable urban planning and design.},

Measures to mitigate the urban heat island include increasing green urban areas and altering the form of cities. Research is needed to explore the impacts of urban form on the surface urban heat island. Research strategy: Data on land surface temperatures for summer 2001 and land cover are combined with meteorological, demographic, and topographic data for European urban regions, delineated as larger urban zones. To ensure a comprehensive view, three ways of quantifying surface urban heat island are calculated and stratified for morning and evening, and climate zones. Linear models reveal the relative influence of the four factors: (1) composition (e.g., share of different land covers in the urban region), (2) configuration (e.g., spatial arrangement), (3) location (e.g., distance to coast or elevation), and (4) population. Findings: The explanatory power (i.e., adj. R-sq) of the models varies strongly...},

Much of his studies on climate, including his description, analysis and observations, are contained in CLIMATE, which can reasonably claim to be the first textbook on climatology. Despite its title, the majority of the book is concerned with weather and climate in general, rather than that of the London metropolis. Nevertheless, one hundred and thirty-two years after its publication, Chandler dedicated his study of the spatial and temporal character of metropolis' climate to Luke Howard (1772-1864), whom he described as the pioneer of urban climatic studies.},

Over 80% of nights are characterized by surplus heat in towns, amounting to 2–4°C, and sporadically to 8°C and more. A distinct annual course of the UHI intensity is observed; the greatest differences occur during summer nights when skies are clear. In winter, favorable conditions for the existence of the UHI occur less frequently, and the intensity of the UHI is smaller. In the daytime the city is very often colder than its surroundings. Two types of spatial structure of the heat island have been observed: multi-cellular type, occurring on windless conditions (0–1m/s), and a more simple general type with the 2–4m/s wind. The distribution of temperature on the night of February 2/3 and 5/6 1996 is presented; the UHI reached an extremely high intensity then (up to 12°C).},

@article{Grimmond2007,
abstract = {The extent and rate of global environmental changes, whether greenhouse gas-induced warming, deforestation, desertification, or loss in biodiversity, are driven largely by the rapid growth of the Earth's human population. Given the large and ever-increasing fraction of the world's population living in cities, and the disproportionate share of resources used by these urban residents, especially in the global North, cities and their inhabitants are key drivers of global environmental change. Here attention is directed to the impact of cities on climate. The focus is not on the effects of cities on global-scale climate, rather the effects globally of cities at regional and local scales. Distinct urban climates at these scales have long been recognized (dating back to Howard 1833). Locally, they are of greater magnitude than projected global-scale climate change and enhance the vulnerability of urban residents to future global environmental change. Moreover, interventions at these scales have the potential to mitigate broader environmental change both directly and indirectly. The links between urbanization and global climate change are complex (Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. 2005; Simon this issue). In the context of enhanced global warming, cities affect greenhouse gas sources and sinks both directly and indirectly. For instance, urban areas are the major sources of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels for heating and cooling; from industrial processes; transportation of people and goods, and so forth. Svirejeva-Hopkins et al. (2004) suggest that more than 90% of anthropogenic carbon emissions are generated in cities. The clearing of land for cities and roads, and the demand for goods and resources by urban residents, both historically and today, are the major drivers of regional land use change, such as deforestation, which has reduced the magnitude of global carbon sinks. While predicting climate change and its impacts at a global scale is still highly uncertain, local effects of urbanization on the climate have long been documented (see descriptions in Landsberg 1981). Surface and atmospheric changes associated with the construction and functioning of cities are profound. New surface materials, associated with buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, along with changes to the morphology of the surface, alter energy and water exchanges and airflow. Combined with direct anthropogenic emissions of heat, carbon dioxide and pollutants, these result in distinct urban climates (Landsberg 1981; Oke 1997). One of the best-known urban effects of such development is urban warming; globally cities are almost always warmer than the surrounding rural area (Oke 1973). The magnitude of urban warming is highly variable over both time and space. On average, urban temperatures may be 1–3°C warmer, but under appropriate meteorological conditions (calm, cloud- less nights in winter) air temperatures can be more than 10°C warmer than surrounding rural environ- ments (Oke 1981). However, in some regional settings, for example in arid environments, cities with large amounts of irrigated greenspace (parks, suburban vegetation) may actually be cooler than the surround- ing dry areas (see the results of Grimmond et al. 1993, for example, for Sacramento, California, USA). The underlying physical causes of the urban heat island are complex (Table 1). For any neighbour- hood in any city, the relative balance of controls depends on the nature of the urban environment, human activity, and meteorological conditions. Urban climatologists commonly characterize the morphology of a city in terms of the height, width and density of buildings (see Figure 3, in which sky view factor is defined). These properties, in combi- nation, affect the loss of long wave radiation at night and therefore cooling rates, the solar access during the day and thus the diurnal pattern of heating, and airflow and wind speed at street level. While predicting climate change and its impacts at a global scale is still highly uncertain, local effects of urbanization on the climate have long been documented (see descriptions in Landsberg 1981).

These properties, in combi- nation, affect the loss of long wave radiation at night and therefore cooling rates, the solar access during the day and thus the diurnal pattern of heating, and airflow and wind speed at street level. The radiative, thermal and hydraulic properties of construction materials differ markedly from those of bare rock, soil, vegetation and water, their pre-existing counterparts. In many, though not all, cities the area covered by vegetation decreases. Thus the fraction of solar energy driving evapotran- spiration (the latent heat flux), rather than warming the urban fabric and air (the sensible heat fluxes), decreases. However, the properties of building materials differ widely (Plate 1). For example, roofing materials – asphalt tiles, ceramic tiles, thatch, slate, and corrugated steel/iron – have very different radia- tive properties (albedo, emissivity) and conductive properties (thermal admittance, conductivity) which greatly affect energy uptake and release and thus heating /cooling patterns. Other facets of buildings, for example, walls, are constructed of materials with equally different properties, which have profound effects on heating and cooling patterns and the resulting building and air temperatures.},

The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al.

The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jim{\'{e}}nez-Mu{\~{n}}oz algorithm is used. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We investigated relationships between climate variability and wildfires in endangered pine rockland communities in the Florida Keys, United States, using fire-scarred samples from the canopy dominantPinus elliottiivar.densa.To test broad-scale, spatiotemporal relationships between wildfires and climate, we compared cross-dated fire-scar chronologies from two islands in the lower Florida Keys, Big Pine Key (BPK) and No Name Key (NNK), to measured values of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO; NI{\~{N}}O3.4), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), and divisional temperature and precipitation over the period from 1856 to 1956. Large-scale climate anomalies captured by ENSO (NI{\~{N}}O3.4) and IPO indexes had combined effects on widespread fires. Superposed epoch analysis revealed that widespread fires on BPK occurred during years that were drier than average and when constructive phases (years of combined warm [positive] or cool [negative] phases) of ENSO and the IPO occurred three years and one year prior to fires. Positive phases of the PDO were also significantly associated with widespread fires three years prior to events, but the PDO was not influential one year prior to fires. Although fire years were temporally synchronous between the two islands during the period between 1818 and 1924 (n= 10), we did not find significant relationships between climate and fire on the smaller NNK, which suggests that island size influences the ability to detect broad-scale climate forcing of wildfires in the Florida Keys.

abstract = {This study presents an attempt to resolve fluctuations in surface temperatures at scales of a few seconds to several minutes using time-sequential ther- mography (TST) from a ground-based platform. A scheme is presented to decompose a TST dataset into fluctuating, high-frequency, and long-term mean parts. To demonstrate the scheme's application, a set of four TST runs (day/night, leaves-on/leaves-off) recorded from a 125-m-high platform above a complex urban environment in Berlin, Germany is used. Fluctuations in surface temperatures of different urban facets are measured and related to surface properties (mater- ial and form) and possible error sources. A number of relationships were found: (1) Surfaces with sur- face temperatures that were significantly different from air temperature experienced the highest fluctuations. (2) With increasing surface temperature above (be- low) air temperature, surface temperature fluctuations experienced a stronger negative (positive) skewness. (3) Surface materials with lower thermal admittance (lawns, leaves) showed higher fluctuations than sur- faces with high thermal admittance (walls, roads). (4) Surface temperatures of emerged leaves fluctuate more compared to trees in a leaves-off situation. (5) In many cases, observed fluctuations were coherent across several neighboring pixels. The evidence from (1) to (5) suggests that atmospheric turbulence is a significant contributor to fluctuations. The study underlines the potential of using high-frequency thermal remote sens- ing in energy balance and turbulence studies at complex land–atmosphere interfaces.},

abstract = {Climate change is arguably the great problem confronting humanity, but we have done little to head off this looming catastrophe. In The Perfect Moral Storm, philosopher Stephen Gardiner illuminates our dangerous inaction by placing the environmental crisis in an entirely new light, considering it as an ethical failure. Gardiner clarifies the moral situation, identifying the temptations (or "storms") that make us vulnerable to a certain kind of corruption. First, the world's most affluent nations are tempted to pass on the cost of climate change to the poorer and weaker citizens of the world. Second, the present generation is tempted to pass the problem on to future generations. Third, our poor grasp of science, international justice, and the human relationship to nature helps to facilitate inaction. As a result, we are engaging in willful self-deception when the lives of future generations, the world's poor, and even the basic fabric of life on the planet is at stake. We should wake up to this profound ethical failure, Gardiner concludes, and demand more of our institutions, our leaders and ourselves. "This is a radical book, both in the sense that it faces extremes and in the sense that it goes to the roots." --Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews "The book's strength lies in Gardiner's success at understanding and clarifying the types of moral issues that climate change raises, which is an important first step toward solutions." --Science Magazine "Gardiner has expertly explored some very instinctual and vitally important considerations which cannot realistically be ignored. --Required reading." --Green Prophet "Gardiner makes a strong case for highlighting and insisting on the ethical dimensions of the climate problem, and his warnings about buck-passing and the dangerous appeal of moral corruptions hit home." --Times Higher Education "Stephen Gardiner takes to a new level our understanding of the moral dimensions of climate change. A Perfect Moral Storm argues convincingly that climate change is the greatest moral challenge our species has ever faced - and that the problem goes even deeper than we think." --Peter Singer, Princeton University},

abstract = {The paper addresses the question of whether the modeling practice of summing separate land-cover tiles to give urban fluxes at the neighborhood scale has merit. A central-city site in Basel, Switzerland, was instrumented to measure turbulent sensible heat fluxes QH from the two main land-cover types (roofs and canyons) separately and from the whole neighborhood. Path-averaged QH values were measured in the roughness sublayer (RSL) using scintillometry, and the spatially averaged QH neighborhood-scale flux was measured in the inertial sublayer (ISL) by an eddy-covariance system. The roof and canyon flux results are combined and weighted according to the respective plan-area abundance of each to give an estimated value of the neighborhood flux. The results show that this “bottom up” approach underestimates the measured ISL values by about 25% when averaged across all periods and wind directions. This finding led to consideration of possible errors from instrumentation, inappropriate turbulent source areas, failure to sample representative surfaces, and inability to fully capture RSL heat exchange. Sorting data by the two main wind directions revealed significant differences. The measured fluxes in the ISL and across the canyon top depend little upon wind direction, but daytime roof values show a marked sensitivity to wind direction. Qualitative analysis suggests this might be caused by systematic controls such as solar angle, site morphometry, and observational setup. The comparison of bottom up versus ISL is inconclusive; in some conditions agreement appears promising, and in others it does not. The question has not been proven or disproven. It may be too ambitious to test the concept at a real-world site.},

abstract = {A data set spanning a period of 10 years and obtained from a combination of satellite remote sensing and model predictions is used to construct a global climatology of ocean wind and wave conditions. Results are presented for: significant wave height, peak and mean wave period and wave direction as well as wind speed and direction. The results are presented in terms of mean monthly statistics. The processed data set provides global resolution of 2°. The climatology clearly shows the zonal variation in both wind speed and wave height, with extreme conditions occurring at high latitudes. The important role played by the intense wave generation systems of the Southern Ocean is clear. Swell generated from storms in the Southern Ocean penetrates throughout the Indian, South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. During the Southern Hemisphere winter, this swell even penetrates into the North Pacific. The results confirm visual observations that the Southern Ocean is consistently the roughest ocean on earth. It is shown, however, that this is mainly caused by consistent high wind speeds, rather than the extended westerly fetch which exists. The west coasts of most continents have noticeably rougher wave climates than their respective east coasts, as a result of the longer generation fetches which exist on the west coasts.

abstract = {Urban heat islands (UHIs) describe the phenomenon of altered temperatures that occur in urban areas when compared to their rural surroundings. UHIs influence human well-being, human health and the city as an ecological niche. UHIs can be quantified with meteorological ground measurements of air temperatures or with remotely sensed land surface temperatures (surface urban heat island). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages and are rarely combined. Further, within these approaches, different indicators for quantifying the UHIs are used. In this methodological study, we (1) combined data on land surface and air temperatures, (2) enriched the debate by suggesting the application of indicators for the two distinct data sets and (3) systematically quantified indicators of all approaches for the city of Leipzig, Germany. A relationship between the land surface and air temperatures was established. However, the results for the single indicators showed that the absolute values of the detected UHI in Leipzig depend on the selected indicator and the data set used. The main conclusion for future studies on UHIs is to use several UHI indicators in parallel to acknowledge the uncertainty of measuring the UHI using a single indicator and either ground measurements or remote sensing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, less attention has been placed on the cooling effect of city's green areas. To address this issue, temperature and humidity measurements were conducted in two big city green areas. One is the city's natural reserve - Bukit Batok Nature Park (BBNP) (36 ha) and the other is a neighbourhood park - Clementi Woods Park (CWP) (12 ha). The measurements were conducted at both vegetated areas and their surroundings. The results indicated the cooling effects of city greens are remarkable not only at vegetated areas but also the surrounding built environments. To further explore the role of the green area on moderating the microclimate, two simulation programmes, TAS and Envi-met, were employed, respectively, for the two parks. The aims are to explore the patterns of energy consumptions of a typical commercial building near to Bukit Batok Nature Park and different thermal conditions with and without Clementi Woods. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Focus was put upon on the examination of frequency, timing and duration of the Urban Moisture Excess (UME) ($\Delta$eu−r > 0 hPa). It was found that the urban site was more humid (0 hPa < $\Delta$eu−r⩽0.5 hPa; weak UME) in 31.4% of the cases investigated and was only rarely significantly more humid ($\Delta$eu−r > 0.5 hPa; intense UME) in 4.6%. Weak and intense UME occur during every month of the year with different frequencies per month. A diurnal course of UME was found for summer but not for winter. Weak and intense UME events show frequency maxima in the second half of the night. Most of them are characterized by durations of 1 hour, in few cases several hours duration were observed for weak (up to 14 h) and intense UME (up to 12 h). The main reason for formation of UME events might be that the surface dew point at the rural station was reached more often, earlier and lasted longer in comparison to the urban environment.

Landsat-ETM offers a unique resolution on 60??m, but with only daytime imagery at about the same time of MODIS overpass is available. This enables the validation of satellite measurements from different sensors with ground measurements at locations with various degrees of spatial homogeneity/heterogeneity (urban/rural land use). Several different algorithms for NOAA-AVHRR data were compared with in-situ measurements.

abstract = {This study focused on atmospheric corrections of airborne thermal infrared remote sensing data acquired with a multidirectional and single broadband channel sensor during the ReSeDA experiment. For single channel sensors, atmospheric corrections are generally performed using atmospheric radiative transfer models such as MODTRAN 3.5 along with radiosoundings. A sensitivity study was performed using MODTRAN 3.5 simulations to assess the accuracy of the processing regarding the experimental context. It was shown that the local topography and the atmosphere spatial variability could affect significantly the radiosounding representativeness, whereas the fluctuations of the flight altitude around the nominal value induced non-negligible inaccuracies. Moreover, using a broadband sensor induced non-linear effects that required a second order correction and also the use of look-up tables to reduce computation time. A theoretical error was next proposed to account for both the sensor accuracy and the experimental uncertainties considered when performing the sensitivity study. This theoretical error was about 1°C, and agreed well with the results obtained when validating against field measurements.},

Air and ground surface temperatures measured at meteorological stations in large cities (population over 300,000) in South Korea were compared with in situ brightness temperature data. The correlation coefficient between air temperatures and brightness temperatures is 0.85 and the relationship may be expressed by the regression: AT=0.59 BT + 2.54. This equation explains 73% of variances at the 0.02% significance level. The best-fit line, however, underestimates air temperatures in such heat-processing industrial cities as Ulsan and Pohang, where smoke puffs up from the high stacks of industrial plants, and overestimates them in the Seoul metropolitan area. The regression equation of ground surface temperatures on brightness temperatures explains 72% of variances. Assuming that optimal meteorological conditions can be selected, the regression equation can be used as a tool to assess air temperature fields in cities. Urban land-use, such as built-up, residential and industrial areas, was clearly identified from the AVHRR thermal data, while small-scale land-use, like parks, were not distinguishable. Brightness temperatures for the intensity of heat islands were related to the population size of cities. The areal magnitude of heat islands in the Seoul metropolitan area expanded considerably, reflecting the conurbation trend for the period 1986-1989. Urban temperatures in the area increased during the period, while temperature gradients declined.},

abstract = {Cities measure the structure and function of their urban forest resource to optimize forest management and the provision of ecosystem services. Measurements made using plot sampling methods yield useful results including citywide or land-use level estimates of species counts, leaf area, biomass, and air pollution reduction. However, these quantities are statistical estimates made over large areas and thus are not spatially explicit. Maps of forest structure and function at the individual tree crown scale can enhance management decision-making and improve understanding of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services relative to humans and infrastructure. In this research we used hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar data to directly map urban forest species, leaf area index (LAI), and carbon storage in downtown Santa Barbara, California. We compared these results to estimates produced using field-plot sampling and the i-Tree Eco model. Remote sensing methods generally reduced uncertainty in species-level canopy cover estimates compared to field-plot methods. This was due to high classification accuracy for species with large canopies (e.g., Platanus racemosa with ∼90% average accuracy, Pinus pinea at ∼93%, Quercus agrifolia at ∼83%) and high standard error of the plot-based estimates due to the uneven distribution of canopy throughout the city. Average LAI in canopy, based on lidar measurements was 4.47 while field measurements and allometry resulted in an LAI of 5.57. Citywide carbon storage, based on lidar measurements and allometry was estimated at 50,991 metric tons (t) and 55,900t from plot-sampling. As others have noted, carbon density varied substantially by development intensity based largely on differences in fractional cover but less so when only evaluating canopy biomass. Using separate biomass equations for each leaf type (broadleaf, needleleaf, palm) resulted in a more accurate carbon map but a less accurate citywide estimate.},

abstract = {Dierences between the temperature of vegetated urban parks and that of their surrounding built environment are reported. The study is based on observations of surface and air temperature in Vancouver, BC and Sacramento, CA. during summer conditions. A combination of remotely sensed surface temper- ature and air temperature from {\textregistered}xed station and mobile (car and bicycle) traverses is used to characterize the magnitude of park-induced coolnessÐthe `park cool island' (PCI) eect. Relatively large surface PCI are present by day and at night, although for dierent reasons. Air temperature eects are smaller. In Vancouver, parks are typically 1±2 {\ss}C, but in ideal conditions can be almost 5 {\ss}C cooler than their surroundings. Larger PCI are possible in Sacramento where irrigated green- space can be 5±7 {\ss}C cooler. Park type, especially the extent of irrigation and the presence of trees, is important in PCI development. During the day trees may play an important role in establishing a cool park eect, perhaps through a combination of shade and evaporative cooling. At night it appears that the surface geometry and moisture status of the park are important controls on surface cooling. Open parks (with higher sky view factors) that have dry soils (and hence lower thermal admittance) cool the most. Nocturnal cooling in open grass parks is often similar to that at rural sites. The in¯uence of parks on air temperatures appears to be restricted to a distance of about one park width.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic exchanges of the old city center of Marseilles during a summer period are analyzed with the SOLENE thermo-radiative model, using measurements of the UBL-ESCOMPTE experimental campaign in June-July 2001. The selected scene is an actual fragment of the urban canopy composed of 4 streets at right angles, with various 19th century houses and yards. The SOLENE software's ability to simulate the heat and radiation exchanges of this urban district with the atmosphere is first evaluated by comparing simulation outputs with surface temperatures of individual roof and fa??ade elements measured by infrared radiation thermometers and with integrated fluxes measured on top of a neighboring meteorological mast. This model assessment is reinforced by a sensitivity study to the interior building temperature, a variable of possible influence which is usually not measured in studies at the scale of an urban fragment or district. The flux sensor position influence on the comparison is also studied by introducing a virtual sensor in the simulated scene. The software is further used to analyze the behavior of individual surface elements of the scene with various orientations during a typical summer diurnal cycle. The contributions of the different surface classes (roofs, fa??ades, streets, yards) to the upward radiation and heat fluxes to the atmosphere are then detailed for several canopy morphologies (H/W). ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Estimating the likelihood of future climate change has become a priority objective within the research community. This is the case because of the advancement of science, because of user demand and because of the central role played by climate prediction in guiding adaptation policy. But are probabilities what climate policy really needs? This article reviews three key questions: (1) Why might we (not) need probabilities of climate change? (2) What are the problems in estimating probabilities? (3) How are researchers estimating probabilities? These questions are analysed within the context of adaptation to climate change. Overall, we conclude that the jury is still out on whether probabilities are useful for climate adaptation policy. The answer is highly context dependent and thus is a function of the goals and motivation of the policy analysis, the unit of analysis, timescale and the training of the analyst. Probability assessment in the context of climate change is always subjective, conditional and provisional. There are various problems in estimating the probability of future climate change, but reflexive human behaviour (i.e. actions explicitly influenced by information) is largely intractable in the context of prediction. Nonetheless, there is considerable scope to develop novel methodologies that combine conditional probabilities with scenarios and which are relevant for climate decision-making.},

abstract = {A methodology is proposed to analyze the radiative and thermal exchanges between a small urban neighborhood and the atmosphere based on the use of the thermoradiative model SOLENE and radiometric measurements to optimize the effective values of its constant parameters. Applied to the center of Toulouse, France, the optimization data are building surface temperatures measured with handheld radiometers and a downward-facing pyranometer during one of the intense observation periods of the CAnopy and Particles Interactions in TOulouse Urban Layer (CAPITOUL) experimental campaign. The quality of the simulations is assessed by comparing, without any other model adjustment, the model outputs for two diurnal cycles (1 day in summer and 1 day in winter) against two independent experimental datasets from fixed permanent radiometers and from sensors measuring the solar, infrared and sensible heat fluxes to the atmosphere at the top of a mast 30 m above the roofs. These simulations allow us to further analyze the separate contributions of the different surface classes, roofs, facades and pavement to these fluxes and to compare them with their counterparts observed over a neighborhood of Marseilles city center during a previous experiment. The partition is remarkably similar in Toulouse and Marseilles: 6–7% for the solar radiation, 73–76% for the infrared radiation and 17–20% for the sensible heat flux. The contribution of roofs to the infrared flux appears proportional to their plan area proportion (built density) but not the contributions to the other two fluxes. The contributions of facades to all three fluxes are roughly proportional to their fraction of the total surface area.},

abstract = {Urban environments can modify the local climate and are net CO(2) emitters, both of which can affect the life of an increasing proportion of the world's population that lives in and around cities. Observational information on the seasonal and diurnal variations of CO(2) fluxes (F(CO2)) as well as on the contribution from the different CO(2) sources and sinks is needed at fine spatial resolution to help develop and validate weather prediction and atmospheric dispersion models. This study reports on F(CO2) measured using the eddy covariance technique for a two-year period over a suburban and an urban residential area as well as a reference agricultural site located in the Montreal region, which experiences cold winters and warm summers. The seasonal and diurnal variability of F(CO2) and its response to incoming light and to air temperature was analysed. Typical weekday and weekend vehicular traffic CO(2) emissions (E(VT)) were estimated from inventory data for both residential sites. The urban site was a net source of CO(2) throughout the entire measurement period on the order of 200 t CO(2) ha(-1) year(-1). The suburban site was a winter source and a summer daytime sink of CO(2) resulting in a net source of 50 t CO(2) ha(-1) y(-1).Lower emissions at the suburban site are attributed to the large biological uptake in summer and to its low anthropogenic emissions. Higher emissions at the urban site are partly associated with its greater population and building density, promoting higher emissions from vehicular traffic and heating fuel combustion. The cold climate induced increased heating fuel combustion as compared to cities under a warmer climate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {All analyses of the impact of urban heat islands (UHIs) on in situ temperature observations suffer from inhomogeneities or biases in the data. These inhomogeneities make urban heat island analyses difficult and can lead to erroneous conclusions. To remove the biases caused by differences in elevation, latitude, time of observation, instrumentation, and nonstandard siting, a variety of adjustments were applied to the data. The resultant data were the most thoroughly homogenized and the homogeneity adjustments were the most rigorously evaluated and thoroughly documented of any large-scale UHI analysis to date. Using satellite night-lights–derived urban/rural metadata, urban and rural temperatures from 289 stations in 40 clusters were compared using data from 1989 to 1991. Contrary to generally accepted wisdom, no statistically significant impact of urbanization could be found in annual temperatures. It is postulated that this is due to micro- and local-scale impacts dominating over the mesoscale urban heat island. Industrial sections of towns may well be significantly warmer than rural sites, but urban meteorological observations are more likely to be made within park cool islands than industrial regions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Characterizing intra-urban variation in air quality is important for epidemiological investigation of health outcomes and disparities. To date, however, few studies have been designed to capture spatial variation during select hours of the day, or to examine the roles of meteorology and complex terrain in shaping intra-urban exposure gradients.\n\nMETHODS: We designed a spatial saturation monitoring study to target local air pollution sources, and to understand the role of topography and temperature inversions on fine-scale pollution variation by systematically allocating sampling locations across gradients in key local emissions sources (vehicle traffic, industrial facilities) and topography (elevation) in the Pittsburgh area. Street-level integrated samples of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) were collected during morning rush and probable inversion hours (6-11 AM), during summer and winter. We hypothesized that pollution concentrations would be: 1) higher under inversion conditions, 2) exacerbated in lower-elevation areas, and 3) vary by season.\n\nRESULTS: During July - August 2011 and January - March 2012, we observed wide spatial and seasonal variability in pollution concentrations, exceeding the range measured at regulatory monitors. We identified elevated concentrations of multiple pollutants at lower-elevation sites, and a positive association between inversion frequency and NO2 concentration. We examined temporal adjustment methods for deriving seasonal concentration estimates, and found that the appropriate reference temporal trend differs between pollutants.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our time-stratified spatial saturation approach found some evidence for modification of inversion-concentration relationships by topography, and provided useful insights for refining and interpreting GIS-based pollution source indicators for Land Use Regression modeling.},

abstract = {Impervious surface area (ISA) from the Landsat TM-based NLCD 2001 dataset and land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS averaged over three annual cycles (2003-2005) are used in a spatial analysis to assess the urban heat island (UHI) skin temperature amplitude and its relationship to development intensity, size, and ecological setting for 38 of the most populous cities in the continental United States. Development intensity zones based on %ISA are defined for each urban area emanating outward from the urban core to the non-urban rural areas nearby and used to stratify sampling for land surface temperatures and NDVI. Sampling is further constrained by biome and elevation to insure objective intercomparisons between zones and between cities in different biomes permitting the definition of hierarchically ordered zones that are consistent across urban areas in different ecological setting and across scales. We find that ecological context significantly influences the amplitude of summer daytime UHI (urban-rural temperature difference) the largest (8 ??C average) observed for cities built in biomes dominated by temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. For all cities combined, ISA is the primary driver for increase in temperature explaining 70% of the total variance in LST. On a yearly average, urban areas are substantially warmer than the non-urban fringe by 2.9 ??C, except for urban areas in biomes with arid and semiarid climates. The average amplitude of the UHI is remarkably asymmetric with a 4.3 ??C temperature difference in summer and only 1.3 ??C in winter. In desert environments, the LST's response to ISA presents an uncharacteristic "U-shaped" horizontal gradient decreasing from the urban core to the outskirts of the city and then increasing again in the suburban to the rural zones. UHI's calculated for these cities point to a possible heat sink effect. These observational results show that the urban heat island amplitude both increases with city size and is seasonally asymmetric for a large number of cities across most biomes. The implications are that for urban areas developed within forested ecosystems the summertime UHI can be quite high relative to the wintertime UHI suggesting that the residential energy consumption required for summer cooling is likely to increase with urban growth within those biomes.},

abstract = {Air pollution is a thoroughly hybrid phenomenon. It is composed of inseparable physical, scientific, cultural, social, economic and political dimensions. It is both an object of environmental science and embedded in our everyday social and cultural worlds. Nevertheless, much air pollution scholarship focuses solely on the physical dimensions of air pollution which are expressed quantitatively and pays little or no regard to the identities, discourses, bodies and emotions which constitute and are constituted by air pollution as a physical reality. This article argues for a more reflexive and hybrid approach to air pollution research which bridges intellectually confining binaries. Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour and other actor-network theorists, it argues that if we can let go of a foundational nature, disrupt our humanism and take non-scientific knowledges seriously, we might develop a new respect for the atmospheric environment and begin the task of building a better common world. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study focused on atmospheric corrections of airborne thermal infrared remote sensing data acquired with a multidirectional and single broadband channel sensor during the ReSeDA experiment. For single channel sensors, atmospheric corrections are generally performed using atmospheric radiative transfer models such as MODTRAN 3.5 along with radiosoundings. A sensitivity study was performed using MODTRAN 3.5 simulations to assess the accuracy of the processing regarding the experimental context. It was shown that the local topography and the atmosphere spatial variability could affect significantly the radiosounding representativeness, whereas the fluctuations of the flight altitude around the nominal value induced non-negligible inaccuracies. Moreover, using a broadband sensor induced non-linear effects that required a second order correction and also the use of look-up tables to reduce computation time. A theoretical error was next proposed to account for both the sensor accuracy and the experimental uncertainties considered when performing the sensitivity study. This theoretical error was about 1°C, and agreed well with the results obtained when validating against field measurements.},

abstract = {Since their introduction 40 years ago, worldwide interest in urban climatic map (UCMap) studies has grown. Today, there are over 15 countries around the world processing their own climatic maps, developing urban climatic guidelines, and implementing mitigation measures for local planning practices. Facing the global issue of climate change, it is also necessary to include the changing climatic considerations holistically and strategically in the planning process, and to update city plans. This paper reviews progress in UCMap studies. The latest concepts, key methodologies, selected parameters, map structure, and the procedures of making UCMaps are described in the paper. The mitigation measures inspired by these studies and the associated urban climatic planning recommendations are also examined. More than 30 relevant studies around the world have been cited, and both significant developments and existing problems are discussed. The thermal environment and air ventilation condition within the urban canopy layer (UCL) of the city are important in the analytical processes of the climatic-environmental evaluation. Possible mitigation measures and planned actions include decreasing anthropogenic heat release, improving air ventilation at the pedestrian level, providing more shaded areas, increasing greenery, creating air paths, and controlling building morphologies. Further developments have and will continue to focus on the spatial analysis of human thermal comfort in urban outdoor environments and on the impacts and adaptations of climate change. Mapmakers must continue to share lessons and experiences with city planners and policy makers, especially in the rapidly expanding cities of developing countries and regions.},

The model has been tested successfully using observations from a monitored green roof in Florida. A preliminary set of parametric tests has been conducted on prototypical 4000 m2 office buildings in Chicago IL and Houston TX. These tests focus on evaluating the role of growing media depth, irrigation, and vegetation density (leaf area index) on both natural gas and electricity consumption. Building energy consumption was found to vary significantly in response to variations in these parameters. Further, this response depended significantly on building location (climate). Hence, it is evident that the green roof simulation tool presented here can serve a valuable role in informing green roof design decisions. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Thermal remote sensing of urban areas is affected by directional variations (anisotropy) of the upwelling thermal radiation. The anisotropy arises due to the three-dimensionally rough urban surface that creates microscale patterns of surface temperature variability associated with surface position, orientation and composition, coupled with a biased view of this rough surface by the remote sensor. The large magnitudes of observed urban thermal anisotropy suggest it can be a significant factor in the interpretation of urban surface characteristics such as the surface urban heat island and application of urban surface temperatures to modelling urban surface heat fluxes. Here we couple the SUM urban surface sensor view model (Soux et al. 2004) with the urban canopy energy balance model of Mills (1997) and a newly developed three-dimensional energy balance model to investigate the variability of thermal anisotropy with surface geometric parameters. Relatively large anisotropy is modelled for realistic urban H/W ratios, and realistic plan area ratios generate a 30% variability of the thermal anisotropy over urban surfaces. Coupled simulations with both energy balance models yielded similar results for anisotropy in the case study examined. The simulations substantially under-estimated the anisotropy compared to observations from a helicopter-mounted thermal scanner despite showing good agreement between modelled and observed temperature differences between major urban surface facets. This suggests the simplified urban surface geometry used by the models is inadequate to replicate the observed anisotropy.},

The height of the daily maximum temperature ZTmax varied with the season; ZTmax was at the roof level in winter but near the ground in summer. The seasonal change of ZTmax is likely due to the change of height at which solar energy is absorbed.

The facility has been a spectacular success in terms of its operational characteristics (as measured by data recovery), the range of phenomena observed and the research that it has spawned. Examples are provided of the types of phenomena observed since its initial deployment. These include observations of boundary layer structure, cloud signatures, forest fire plumes and evidence of singular long-range pollutant and volcanic transport events. Observations from CORALNet-UBC complement data from other aerosol measurement initiatives in the region and provide a rich source of information that is relevant to researchers, operational forecasters and air quality managers.

abstract = {A web-based software tool has been developed to assist urban planners and air quality management officials in assessing the potential of urban heat island mitigation strategies to affect the urban climate, air quality, and energy consumption within their cities. The user of the tool can select from over 170 US cities for which to conduct the analysis, and can specify city-wide changes in surface reflectivity and/or vegetative cover. The Mitigation Impact Screening Tool (MIST) then extrapolates results from a suite of simulations for 20 cities to estimate air temperature changes associated with the specified changes in surface characteristics for the selected city. Alternatively the user can simply define a nominal air temperature reduction that they hope to achieve with an unspecified mitigation scenario. These air temperature changes are then input to energy and ozone models to estimate the impact that the mitigation action may have on the selected city. The results presented by MIST include a high degree of uncertainty and are intended only as a first-order estimate that urban planners can use to assess the viability of heat island mitigation strategies for their cities.

abstract = {Observations of a plume emanating from a 30-min duration pyrotechnic display with a lidar ceilometer are described for an urban setting in complex, coastal terrain. Advection of the plume across the ceilometer occurred at a mean height of 250 m AGL. The plume traveled downwind at ∼3 m s−1, and at a distance of 8 km downwind, was ∼100 m in vertical thickness with particulate matter (PM) concentrations of order 30–40 $\mu$g m−3. Surface PM observations from surrounding urban monitoring stations suggest that the plume was not mixed to ground over the urban area. Plume trajectories at ∼250 m simulated by three numerical models all traveled to the northeast of the ceilometer location. Horizontal plume dispersion estimates suggest that the model trajectories were too far north to accommodate the likely lateral plume spread necessary to explain the ceilometer observations. This poor agreement between near surface observations and model output is consistent with previous mesoscale model validations in this region of complex urbanized terrain, and suggests that despite improvements in mesoscale model resolution, there remains an urgent need to improve upstream initial conditions over the Pacific Ocean, data assimilation over complex terrain, the representation of urban areas in mesoscale models, and to further validate such models for nocturnal applications in complex settings.},

abstract = {Surface layer plumes, thermals, downdrafts and roll vortices are the most prominent coherent structures in an unstably stratified boundary layer. They contribute most of the temperature and vertical velocity variance, and their time scales increase with height. The effects of these multi-scale structures (surface layer plumes scale with surface layer depth, thermals scale with boundary layer height and the resulting roll vortices scale with convective time scale) on the surface temperature and ground heat flux were studied using turbulence measurements throughout the atmospheric boundary layer and the surface temperature measurements from an infrared camera. Plumes and thermals imprint on the surface temperature as warm structures and downdrafts imprint as cold structures. The air temperature trace shows a ramp-like pattern, with small ramps overlaid on a large ramp very close to the surface; on the other hand, surface temperature gradually increases and decreases. Turbulent heat flux and ground heat flux show similar patterns, with the former lagging the latter. The maximum values of turbulent heat flux and ground heat flux are 4 and 1.2 times the respective mean values during the ejection event. Surface temperature fluctuations follow a similar power-law exponent relationship with stability as suggested by surface layer similarity theory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The influence of vegetation on the urban climate was studied in the subtropical city Gaborone, the rapidly expanding capital of Botswana with approximately 200 000 inhabitants. Temperature records from an urban and a rural station were analysed for the period 1985–96. In an attempt to explain possible seasonal change in vegetation, NOAA satellite normalized difference vegetation index imagery was analysed. The present urban influence was investigated with temperature loggers at selected urban and rural sites. In addition, mobile measurements revealed spatial patterns in temperature and humidity for different land uses. Seasonal patterns of urban–rural differences in minimum temperatures emerge during the period 1994–96, especially during the winter when the heat island effect is largest. It is shown that differences in urban and rural vegetation over the year partly explain this variation. Mobile measurements reveal a weak nocturnal heat island of 2–3 °C during clear and calm nights. There are intra-urban temperature differences that are in the same range as the urban–rural relationship due to the role of vegetation. Evapotranspiration lowers the temperature, which was detected by high humidity in areas of lush vegetation. This becomes apparent at midday, when densely vegetated areas were up to 2 °C cooler than rural sites. An oasis effect, therefore, only exists on a highly local basis. In contrast, parts of the city with sparse vegetation are warmer than the countryside. There is an apparent opposed effect of rural and urban vegetation, whereby the former is hindering the temperature from falling and the latter is cooling the environment through evapotranspiration. This can be explained by the overwhelming amounts of imported water in the city promoting evaporative cooling},

To date, no comparison of these models has been conducted; in contrast, models for natural surfaces have been compared extensively as part of the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameterization Schemes. Here, the methods and first results from an extensive international comparison of 33 models are presented. The aim of the comparison overall is to understand the complexity required to model energy and water exchanges in urban areas. The degree of complexity included in the models is outlined and impacts on model performance are discussed. During the comparison there have been significant developments in the models with resulting improvements in performance (root-mean-square error falling by up to two-thirds).

Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 111, 109-132.] is modified to include a coupling of SUM with the actual building structure of a study area, thereby allowing variable building heights and shapes to be represented within SUM as well as the provision for an inter-building spacing that provides a more realistic urban block structure in the internal SUM urban surface representation. Model simulations using both modifications are performed and compared with airborne observations of surface temperature made over a Light Industrial area and a downtown area of Vancouver, BC. The results are generally good, although there is a general tendency to underestimate the overall thermal anisotropy. Use of mean facet temperatures in the validation limits validation statistics for one study area; improvements are made when facet temperatures are updated from individual flight lines. Performing a sensitivity analyses on the contributions to the thermal anisotropy suggests that surface structure and microscale temperature variability both make substantial contributions to the total anisotropy. This finding underscores the importance of including microscale temperature variability in assessments of urban thermal anisotropy. Full hemispheric plots of directional temperature and statistics for each study area are presented as an application of the model and show smooth variations in directional temperature when averaged over the study area. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park's northern winter range. We found that browsing on the five tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100% of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of <25% in the uplands and <20% in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years. We also synthesized studies on trophic cascades published during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction. Synthesis results generally indicate that the reintroduction of wolves restored a trophic cascade with woody browse species growing taller and canopy cover increasing in some, but not all places. After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In urban environments where the\nstructural complexity is high, for example, lidar is seen as a critical\nand innovative dataset to improve the characterization of both\nvegetation and building attributes. Using a small-footprint, first-and\nlast-return lidar dataset of Vancouver, Canada, we demonstrate the\npotential to derive a suite of attributes important for describing the\ninteractions of the urban surface and atmosphere in weather\nforecasting, air pollution, and urban dispersion modelling. Two levels\nof attributes were defined. First, primary attributes such as building\nshape, size, and location and tree classification were calculated.\nBuilding extent and size were computed using an object-based approach\nbased on connectivity and height rules. The classification of tree\ncrown areas was derived from the location of last-return data, filtered\nto remove the incidence of last returns caused by the interaction of\nthe lidar beam with building edges, and height rules. Validation showed\nthat building areas derived from lidar compared well with aerial\nphotography estimates (r(2) = 0.96, p < 0.001, n = 98). The percentage\ndifference between estimates was equal to 16% (n = 83) when buildings\nwere discriminated from the surrounding features. However, the\npercentage difference between estimates increased to 35% (n = 98) when\ncommission errors were considered, as lidar often overestimated\nbuilding areas due to closely spaced buildings (gaps less than 1-2 m)\nnot being separated. Similarly, the height and area of lidar-extracted\ntrees were highly correlated with field-based measurements (r(2) = 0.84\nand 0.76, respectively, p < 0.001, n = 50). Once these primary\nattributes were derived, we demonstrate the extraction of a number of\nsecondary attributes including building mean height, normalized\nbuilding volume, building wall surface area, and interelement spacing.\nOf significance, this research has shown that lidar can provide\nspatially detailed estimates of urban structure and cover which\ncharacterize the aerodynamic and energetic properties of urban areas.},

abstract = {Scale modelling is used to determine the relative contribution of heat transfer processes to the nocturnal cooling of urban parks and the characteristic temporal and spatial variation of surface temperature. Validation is achieved using a hardware model-to-numerical model-to-field observation chain of comparisons. For the calm case, modelling shows that urban-park differences of sky view factor and thermal admittance are the relevant properties governing the park cool island (PCI) effect. Reduction in sky view factor by buildings and trees decreases the drain of longwave radiation from the surface to the sky. Thus park areas near the perimeter where there may be a line of buildings or trees, or even sites within a park containing tree clumps or individual trees, generally cool less than open areas. The edge effect applies within distances of about 2.2 to 3.5 times the height of the border obstruction, i.e., to have any part of the park cooling at the maximum rate a square park must be at least twice these dimensions in width. Although the central areas of parks larger than this will experience greater cooling they will accumulate a larger volume of cold air that may make it possible for them to initiate a thermal circulation and extend the influence of the park into the surrounding city. Given real world values of sky view factor and thermal admittance it seems likely that radiation and conduction play almost equal roles in nocturnal PCI development. Evaporation is not a significant cooling mechanism in the nocturnal calm case but by day it is probably critical in establishing a PCI by sunset. It is likely that conditions that favour PCI by day (tree shade, soil wetness) retard PCI growth at night. The present work, which only deals with PCI growth, cannot predict which type of park will be coolest at night. Complete specification of nocturnal PCI magnitude requires knowledge of the PCI at sunset, and this depends on daytime energetics.},

abstract = {Major reviews of urban effects on local climate, extending from Kratzer in 1937 through to Landsberg in 1981, have dealt primarily with radiation, temperature, wind, and air quality. To a much lesser extent they have examined moisture-related elements including humidity, cloud, precipitation, and storminess. Selecting air temperature to represent the former group and precipitation amount to represent the latter, the author asserts that, because of the intrinsic physical differences between them, there are necessarily important differences in the methods to be used for their proper observation, analysis, presentation, and interpretation pertaining to urban effects. The principal differences are based in the fact that temperature is continuous in both time and space, whereas precipitation is continuous in neither. The author maintains that because of these differences, urban climatologists have had much greater success in specifying and explaining urban effects on temperature than on precipitation amount. Further, he makes the case that, lack of recognition that methods used for the study of urban effects on temperature are too often inappropriate for study of urban effects on precipitation amount, has led to a state of affairs where there remains basic uncertainty about the specification of urban effects on precipitation amount, and even greater uncertainty about their explanation. In making that case, the author includes 1) an historical perspective, 2) a critical evaluation of methods, 3) an overview of the status of urban precipitation climatology, and 4) recommendations concerning future research.

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) cameras perfectly bridge the gap between (i) on-site measurements of land surface temperature (LST) providing high temporal resolution at the cost of low spatial coverage and (ii) remotely sensed data from satellites that provide high spatial coverage at relatively low spatio-temporal resolution. While LST data from satellite (LSTsat) and airborne platforms are routinely corrected for atmospheric effects, such corrections are barely applied for LST from ground-based TIR imagery (using TIR cameras; LSTcam). We show the consequences of neglecting atmospheric effects on LSTcam of different vegetated surfaces at landscape scale. We compare LST measured from different platforms, focusing on the comparison of LST data from on-site radiometry (LSTosr) and LSTcam using a commercially available TIR camera in the region of Bozen/Bolzano (Italy). Given a digital elevation model and measured vertical air temperature profiles, we developed a multiple linear regression model to correct LSTcam data for atmospheric influences. We could show the distinct effect of atmospheric conditions and related radiative processes along the measurement path on LSTcam, proving the necessity to correct LSTcam data on landscape scale, despite their relatively low measurement distances compared to remotely sensed data. Corrected LSTcam data revealed the dampening effect of the atmosphere, especially at high temperature differences between the atmosphere and the vegetated surface. Not correcting for these effects leads to erroneous LST estimates, in particular to an underestimation of the heterogeneity in LST, both in time and space. In the most pronounced case, we found a temperature range extension of almost 10 K.},

abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols scatter and potentially absorb incoming solar radiation, thereby reducing the total amount of radiation reaching the surface and increasing the fraction that is diffuse. The partitioning of incoming energy at the surface into sensible heat flux and latent heat flux is postulated to change with increasing aerosol concentrations, as an increase in diffuse light can reach greater portions of vegetated canopies. This can increase photosynthesis and transpiration rates in the lower canopy and potentially decrease the ratio of sensible to latent heat for the entire canopy. Here, half-hourly and hourly surface fluxes from six Flux Network (FLUXNET) sites in the coterminous United States are evaluated over the past decade (2000-08) in conjunction with satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) to determine if atmospheric aerosols systematically influence sensible and latent heat fluxes. Satellite-derived AOD is used to classify days as high or low AOD and establish the relationship between aerosol concentrations and the surface energy fluxes. High AOD reduces midday net radiation by 6%-65% coupled with a 9%-30% decrease in sensible and latent heat fluxes, although not all sites exhibit statistically significant changes. The partitioning between sensible and latent heat varies between ecosystems, with two sites showing a greater decrease in latent heat than sensible heat (Duke Forest and Walker Branch), two sites showing equivalent reductions (Harvard Forest and Bondville), and one site showing a greater decrease in sensible heat than latent heat (Morgan-Monroe). These results suggest that aerosols trigger an ecosystem-dependent response to surface flux partitioning, yet the environmental drivers for this response require further exploration.},

abstract = {A city's trees provide many environmental and social benefits. To ensure the long-term prosperity of its urban forest, a city should have an effective forest management plan that is guided by timely and accurate spatial information. High-spatial-resolution colour-infrared imagery is a commonly available source of forestry information, but accurate automated tree cover extraction in an urban environment remains a challenge. Presented is an effective, semiautomatic, object-based method for urban tree cover extraction, applied to 23645 ha of 30 cm colour-infrared imagery of London, Ontario, Canada. Detailed methods, including some new techniques, are presented for the empirical selection of segmentation and classification parameters, the selection of subclasses and training samples, rule-based error correction, and image object border smoothing. A majority-voting interpretation of sample points was performed to reduce the subjectivity of the accuracy assessment. A test of the overall classification accuracy using the proposed method on a 2 km × 2 km image tile showed an improvement of 12.8% over that of a traditional maximum likelihood classification. The overall classification accuracy achieved for the entire city was 89.73%, with user's and producer's accuracy for trees of 75.61% and 86.36%, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 CASI.},

abstract = {Northwestern Canada is a genesis region of arctic air masses often considered to be formed primarily through radiative processes. However, the details of their life cycle are poorly understood. This paper examines the formation, maintenance, and dissipation of an intense and long-lived arctic air mass, using a thermodynamic budget analysis. The airmass formation is characterized by a deep-layer, multistage process that begins with snow falling into a nascent air mass. Radiative cooling from cloud tops begins the process. After the snow abates and clear skies are observed, the surface temperature drops rapidly, aided by the high emissivity of fresh snow cover, falling 17 degrees C in two days, creating an intense but shallow temperature inversion. Once the surface temperature falls below the frost point, ice crystals form. Afterward, although the surface temperature remains constant, the height of the inversion rises, as radiative cooling at the top of the ice fog layer decreases temperatures. During the maintenance phase, a cold-air damming structure is present with an anticyclone in the lee of the Canadian Rockies, low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska, and an intense baroclinic zone parallel to the mountains, separating warmer maritime air from colder continental air. The air mass persists for 12 days, undergoing several cycles of deep-layer weakening and intensification.},

abstract = {In this study, the urban heat island of Toronto was characterized and estimated in order to examine the impact of the selection of rural sites on the estimation of urban heat island (UHI) intensity ( Delta T sub(u-r)). Three rural stations, King Smoke Tree (KST), Albion Hill, and Millgrove, were used for the analysis of UHI intensity for two urban stations, Toronto downtown (Toronto) and Toronto Pearson (Pearson) using data from 1970 to 2000. The UHI intensity was characterized as winter dominating and summer dominating, depending on the choice of the rural station. The analyses of annual and seasonal trends of Delta T sub(u-r) suggested that urban heat island clearly appears in winter at both Toronto and Pearson. However, due to the mitigating effect on temperature from Lake Ontario, the estimated trend of UHI intensity was found to be less at Toronto compared to that at Pearson which has no direct lake effect. In terms of the impacts of the rural stations, for both KST and Millgrove, the trends in UHI intensity were found to be statistically significant and also were in good agreement with the estimates of UHI intensities reported for other large cities in the USA. Depending on the choice of the rural station, the estimated trend for the UHI intensity at Toronto ranges from 0.01 degree C/decade to 0.02 degree C/decade, and that at Pearson ranges from 0.03 degree C/decade to 0.035 degree C/decade during 1970-2000. From the analysis of the seasonal distribution of Delta T sub(u-r), the UHI intensity was found to be higher at Toronto in winter than that at Pearson for all three rural stations. This was likely accounted for by the lower amount of anthropogenic heat flux at Pearson. Considering the results from the statistical analysis with respect to the geographic and surface features for each rural station, KST was suggested to be a better choice to estimate UHI intensity at Toronto compared to the other rural stations. The analysis from the current study suggests that the selection of a unique urban-rural pair to estimate UHI intensity for a city like Toronto is a critical task, as it will be for any city, and it is imperative to consider some key features such as the physiography, surface characteristics of the urban and rural stations, the climatology such as the trends in annual and seasonal variation of UHI with respect to the physical characteristics of the stations, and also more importantly the objectives of a particular study in the context of UHI effect.},

@article{Hoerling1997,
abstract = {The paradigm of an atmospheric system varying linearly with respect to extreme phases of the EI Nino-Southern Oscillation is questioned. It is argued that the global response to tropical Pacific sea surface temperature forcing will be inherently nonlinear. A physical basis far this intrinsic nonlinearity is the thermodynamic control on deep convection. Climate statistics for warm and cold events of the tropical Pacific are analyzed separately for the northern winter periods during 1950-96. Composite analysis of 500-mb heights reveal planetary-scale teleconnection patterns, as noted in earlier studies. A new result is the evidence for an appreciable 35 degrees longitude phase shift between the warm and cold event circulation composites, and the two wave trains appear to have different tropical origins. A large nonlinear component in North American surface climate anomalies is also found, which is consistent with such a phase shift in teleconnections. In the Tropics, rainfall anomalies also show evidence of nonlinear behavior. The maximum rain anomalies along the equator are located east of the date line during warm events, but west of the date line during cold events. The interpretation of this behavior is complicated, however, by the fact that composite warm event SST anomalies are not the exact inverse of their cold event counterparts. Idealized atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments are performed in order to test the question of whether the observed nonlinearity is an intrinsic property of the atmospheric system. The model is forced with a composite SST anomaly that undergoes a realistic seasonally varying ENSO life cycle, as described by E. Rasmusson and T. Carpenter. Both positive and negative phases of the SST anomaly are used, and a 40-member ensemble of warm and cold event model simulations is conducted. A nonlinear climate response in the AGCM is found that closely resembles the observed composites, including a shift in the equatorial positions of the maxmium rain responses and a phase shift of teleconnection patterns in the upper troposphere. Barotropic model experiments indicate that the inherent nonlinearity in the tropical rain response may itself be responsible for the phase shift in the extratropical teleconnection patterns.},

abstract = {The spatial resolution of meteorological observations of scalars (such as concentrations or temperature) and scalar fluxes (e.g., water-vapour flux, sensible heat flux) above inhomogeneous surfaces is in general not known. It is determined by the surface area of influence or source area of the sensor, which for sensors of quantities that are subject to turbulent diffusion, depends on the flow and turbulence conditions. Functions describing the relationship between the spatial distribution of surface sources (or sinks) and a measured signal at height in the surface layer have been termed the footprint function or the source weight function, In this paper, the source area of level P is defined as the integral of the source weight function over the smallest possible domain comprising the fraction P of the total surface influence reflected in the measured signal. Source area models for scalar concentration and for passive scalar fluxes are presented. The results of the models are presented as characteristic dimensions of the P = 50% source areas (i.e., the area responsible for 50% of the surface influence): the maximum source location (i.e., the upwind distance of the surface element with the maximum-weight influence), the near and the far end of the source area, and its maximal lateral extension. These numerical model results are related directly to non-dimensional surface-layer scaling variables by a non-linear least squares method in a parameterized model which provides a user-friendly estimate of the surface area responsible for measured concentrations or fluxes, The source area models presented here allow conclusions to be made about the spatial representativeness and the localness (these terms are defined in the text) of flux and concentration measurements.},

A rederivation of the fundamental energy balance of the PIR indicates that the calibration equation in common use in the geophysical community today contains an erroneous factor of the emissivity of the thermopile. If a realistic value (0.98) for the emissivity is used, then this leads to errors in the total flux of 5–10 W m−2. The basic precision of the instrument is found to be about 1.5% of the total IR irradiance when the thermopile voltage and both dome and case temperatures are measured. If the manufacturer's optional battery-compensated output is used exclusively, then the uncertainties increase to about 5% of the total (20 W m−2). It is suggested that a modern radiative transfer model combined with radiosonde profiles can be used as a secondary standard to improve the absolute accuracy of PIR data from field programs.

abstract = {Surface urban heat island (SUHI) is a phenomenon of both high spatial and temporal variability. In this context, studying and monitoring the SUHIs of urban areas through the satellite remote sensing technology, requires land surface temperature (LST) image data from satellite-borne thermal sensors of high spatial resolution as well as temporal resolution. However, due to technical constrains, satellite-borne thermal sensors yield a trade-off between their spatial and temporal resolution; a high spatial resolution is associated with a low temporal resolution and vice versa. To resolve this drawback, we applied in this study four downscaling techniques using different scaling factors to downscale 1-km LST image data provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor, given that AVHRR can offer the highest temporal resolution currently available. The city of Athens in Greece was used as the application site. Downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs simulated by the downscaling techniques, were then used for SUHI intensity estimation based on LST differences observed between the main urban land covers of Athens and the city's rural background. For the needs of the study, land cover information for Athens was obtained from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2000 database for Greece. Validation of the downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs as well of the retrieved SUHI intensities was performed by comparative analysis with time-coincident observations of 120-m LST and SUHI intensities generated from the band 6 of the Thermal Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 platform. The spatial pattern of the downscaled AVHRR LST was found to be visually improved when compared to that of the original AVHRR LST and to resemble more that of TM6 LST. Statistical results indicated that, when compared to 120-m TM6 LST, the root mean square error (RMSE) in 120-m AVHRR LST generated by the downscaling techniques ranged from 4.9 to 5.3????C. However, the accuracy in SUHI intensity was found to have significantly improved, with a RMSE value decreasing from 2.4????C when the original AVHRR LST was utilized, down to 0.94????C in case that downscaling was applied. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast with recent debates, which have centred on the relative status of human geography within policy circles, we focus on the often mundane and messy realities of undertaking policy research. The paper argues that applied policy research offers con- siderable potential for human geographers to pursue substantive and normative concerns, but can also place geographers in complex and demanding situations that present practical and ethical challenges. In such contexts, being ‘relevant' in the manner demanded by policy actors while maintaining critical integrity necessitates a high degree of reflexivity, strategic calculation and tradeoffs between principles and prag- matism. The paper draws on our experience of undertaking contract research on parish and town councils for the UK government. We emphasize the opportunities and pitfalls represented by the internal differ- entiation of the state, the importance of active negotiation and compromise with clients and stakeholders, the mediating role played by the ‘evidence base', the politics of expertise and the use of applied policy research as a platform for wider policy engagement. The paper concludes by calling for greater reflection on the realities of applied policy research.},
